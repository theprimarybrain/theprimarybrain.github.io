Do you use Boom Cards™ with your students? They are one of my favorite tools for digital learning! I started creating them for my son at home and quickly saw the millions of ways that I can use with my first grade students! I really want you to fall in love with them like I have, so I put together a FREE CVC Word Boom Card set that you can try out with your students. I also put together a quick start guide right here so you can get started right away. 

## Here is Your Free CVC Boom Card Deck
