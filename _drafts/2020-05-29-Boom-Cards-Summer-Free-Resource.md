Do you use Boom Cards™ with your students? They are one of my favorite tools for digital learning! I started creating them for my son at home and quickly saw all the ways that I can use Boom Cards with my first grade students! If you are new to Boom Learning, you can [click here](https://theprimarybrain.com/digital%20learning/2020/05/27/How-To-Get-Started-With-Boom-Cards/) to read all about how to get started on Boom Learning. I really want you to fall in love with digital task cards like I have, so I put together a FREE CVC Word Boom Card set that you can try out with your students. 

## Summer CVC Freebie
I created this fun CVC Boom Card set for students to use as they continue learning over the summer. Anything at the beach screams summer to me, so I hope that they enjoy learning under the sea! Just fill out the form below to download this FREE Boom Card set.
