Did you know that about 80% of our child's brain develops by the time they are age 3? When I learned this statistic, I quickly realized the importance of teaching age appropriate skills to our toddlers! Teaching toddlers is so fun and rewarding, but it can also be challenging to know what to teach to 2 and 3 year old children. Young children are always learning. They learn by watching, listening, and playing. They are learning when they pick up a toy, watch a parent cook dinner in the kitchen, or even when they are riding in a shopping cart. 

As parents, we are always wondering what we should be teaching our children to set them up for success later in life. Some days are just about making it to bedtime, but other days we find ourselves wanting intentional learning moments. To try to make it easier for you to know what to do when you sit down to plan a toddler activity, we are diving into 7 skills areas for toddlers that I focus on when planning toddler activities for my own little ones.

In this post, we are diving into 7 skill areas that I think are important to teach to your toddlers. As a mom to three kids (ages 1-8) and a classroom teacher with 11 years of experience, I have seen the differences in children as they grow when we take advantage of learning opportunities during the years of toddler development.

## Language Development for Toddlers

The most important place to start when working with toddlers is communication! Our children are sponges! They are taking in everything we say, so it is especially important to be using a variety of vocabulary when speaking to your toddler. Once our children are able to effectively communicate their needs, a whole new world will open up before them! 

When speaking to toddlers, it is important to use simple words and sentences to avoid overloading their little brains with too many words to process at once.

Our little ones need to be moving! Gross motor skills help to build strong buscles in your child's arms and legs, as well as their hand-eye coordination. Not only will your children love to explore the world around them, but they will also build confidence that will help them with other tasks as they grow.
