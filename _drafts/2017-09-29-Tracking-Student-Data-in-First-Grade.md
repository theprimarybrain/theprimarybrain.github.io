Displaying data is a requirement at my school site. Since I have a superhero theme in my classroom this year, I created a cityscape where students fly up buildings as they meet their goals. This is _all the rage_ among my students this year because they have their own superhero that will soar as they meet their goals!

I currently have buildings to display data for Lexia, sight words, and fluency scores. Each student has their own superhero that I pinned on the wall with a thumb tack. It is **so easy** to modify their levels since all I have to do is move a pin!
