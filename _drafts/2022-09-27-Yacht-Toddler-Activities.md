This week our focus letter is Yy, and what better way to introduce the letter and sound with yacht themed activities!? I created this [Yacht Themed Toddler Unit](ADD YACHT UTM HERE) so you can sail away with lots of learning and fun with your little one this week! 

## Lesson Components 

This unit is made up of 5 lessons that will each work on the following activities:
- literacy/language 
- sensory bin 
- math and science activity 
- fine motor activity 
- gross motor activity 
- art activity 

## Art Activity

To kick off yacht week, you can start with this fun yacht marble art. All you need to do is tape a piece of while construction paper to the bottom of a large cardboard tray or sheet pan. Then, dip marbles in blue paint and yellow paint. Your little one will love rolling the marbles back and forth in the tray to make designs. As the marbles roll and the paint mixes, offer opportunities for your child to observe what happens when the yellow and blue colors mix to make green. After the paint dries, you’ll cut out the yacht from the previous art painting activity and glue it to the top for some beautiful yacht artwork. 
## Fine Motor Activity

Fine motor activities can be simple and fun. For this activity, introduce the shape name “circle”, and give your child a dot marker. Have your child dot inside the circles to make the letter Yy. Give your child multiple opportunities and reminders to say the letter name “Y” as he or she dabs away. 
## Sensory Exploration Activities

Play dough is always a hit in our home, and this sensory activity was no exception. Your little one will love creating a yacht with play dough and popsicle sticks. Remember, it doesn’t have to be perfect. Encourage your child to do their best, use their imagination, and create their very own yacht with the supplies in the bin.

For this next sensory bin activity, fill a bin with water beads or blue rice. Add the yacht shape puzzle pieces to the bin. You’ll want to laminate them for durability if you’re using water beads. Your child will search for the puzzle pieces and match the shapes. As he or she finds shape matches, set them to the side of the bin. Make sure to leave plenty of free time to explore and play with the bin! 
## Math Activity

Giving our little ones lots of opportunities to practice 1:1 correspondence is essential in order for them to build confidence and master this skill. For this activity, you’ll give your child the number match cards and about 30 counters. We love using blue gems or mini erasers! Your child will place a counter on each image on the number match cards. Encourage your child to count aloud as he or she places each counter on the card.
