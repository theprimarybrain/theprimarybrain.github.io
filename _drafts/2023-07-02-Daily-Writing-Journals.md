Do you often find yourself sitting and looking at student work and asking yourself, “Why aren't they writing these letters properly? Why aren't they taking their time when they are writing?”  You taught a wonderful lesson and your students were able to write several sentences, but they aren't taking the time to write neatly and with correct letter formation. 
 
The truth is… our students need to continually practice handwriting DAILY. The problem is, with so much to teach in the one year with our students that we are given, it can sometimes feel like there just isn't time to fit this into our full lesson plans, right?!?
 
I'm so excited to share all about how I incorporate all of these skills into a quick and fun activity in just 10-15 minutes per day that my students absolutely love.
