## Kindergarten Bible Verse Memorization Pack
![Kindergarten Bible Verse Collage]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/Kindergarten-Bible-Verse-Memorization-Pack.jpg)

This [Kindergarten Bible Verse Memorization Pack](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Bible-Verse-Memorization-Pack-for-Kindergarten-3052682?utm_source=TPB%20Blog&utm_campaign=How%20To%20Teach%20Bible%20Verses%20-%20Kinder) includes 20 weeks of Bible verses to help young learners begin to memorize scripture. The verses begin with very simple verses made up of two or more words. In Kindergarten, children will work through three weekly practice pages with an assessment on the final day.

### Day 1: Read and Illustrate the Verse
On the first day, read the verse of the week. You can help your child find the verse in the Bible, or you can read the verse off the wall poster or notecard included in the pack. Then, give your child a fun writing utensil to use to illustrate the verse. We LOVE our [Crayola Supertips Markers](https://amzn.to/2GEYCic) for this!

### Day 2
On the second day, read and trace the verse. Kindergarteners always need handwriting practice, so this is a great way to throw in some extra practice!

### Day 3
On the third day, read and write the verse. 

### Assessment
To assess children on the Bible verse, you will ask your child to recite the verse aloud. If your child is ready to write you can offer the challenge of writing the Bible verse.
