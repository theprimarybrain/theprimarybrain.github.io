Nothing says summer like watermelon! Are you and your littles ready for a summer filled with warm weather? I know we are and we are ready to kick it off with this Watermelon Themed Toddler Unit. I hope you and your littles have so much fun with this unit! 

## Lesson Components 
This unit is made up of 5 lessons that will each work on the following activities:
- literacy/language 
- sensory bin 
- math and science activity 
- fine motor activity 
- art activity 

## Art Activities

This unit is filled with a ton of fun art activities that your little ones will love so let’s kick off your unit with a painting activity. This watermelon plate craft is simple yet super engaging and all you need is a paper plate with some red, green, and black paint. Talk to your little one about what the inside of a watermelon looks like while they are painting. This activity is a great opportunity to practice their painting skills and remind them to make room for all of the colors-don’t forget to paint the seeds!

For another art activity you will give your child the watermelon printable to practice their cutting and pasting skills. This is a great opportunity to work with your child on scissor skills depending on their level they may need a little bit of assistance cutting the small strips. Little ones love activities that include glue and they get to use their tiny muscles to squeeze the glue onto the strips. 

## Fine Motor Activities

Those little hands need to develop strength and dexterity in their tiny muscles. We can help engage those muscles by providing our littles with opportunities to play and explore with all sorts of materials. For this first fine motor activity you will prep your watermelon by poking holes into the watermelon with a golf tee. Be sure to show your little one how to properly hold the watermelon in one hand and the golf tee in another. Give them around 10-20 golf tees to poke into the holes and let them have fun. If you feel your child is developmentally ready you can give them a small wooden hammer to hit the tees. Of course you know your child best and can adapt the activity based on their needs!

Practicing fine motor skills everyday will help your little ones build up those little muscles and we can do this with items we have around the house. In this next activity your child will use a melon baller to scoop out the flesh of the watermelon and it is a great way to have your child help you prepare a snack too! Your little one will love enjoying a piece after all that hard work.

In this activity your child will need pom poms, tweezers and the watermelon printable they will work on squeezing those little muscles to place the pom poms onto the watermelon. Tweezers are one of my favorite ways to put those fine motor skills to work. You can use different colored pom poms and ask your child the color as they place them onto the watermelon. A simple yet great activity for fine motor practice. 

## Sensory Bins

Sensory bins are one of my favorite teaching tools for the little ones. Sensory bins allow for an opportunity to play with tactile materials while they are learning- win-win situation! The sensory bins in this unit all use my watermelon rice recipe which I have included and it’s best to prepare it ahead of time so you’re ready to go. For this first sensory bin you will add some black beans and let your little one explore with spoons, cups, and measuring cups for open-ended play. Talk to your little one about what they are doing, try using words like pour, dump, and measure.

Sensory bins are the perfect way to keep little hands busy and the brain engaged while they practice their letter skills. Using the watermelon rice add in big w and little w letter cards with two dishes for sorting. Talk with your child as they sort the letters, make the w sound and challenge them by asking if they know any words that begin with w. I bet these sensory bins will be a big hit in your house!

I filled this unit with sensory bin activities because I know how hard it can be to pull a little one away- they love them so much. Littles can use their senses to explore while learning which is one of my favorite reasons to use sensory bins with young children. You will use the same filler but add in the mixed up shape cards and your child will dig through the sensory bin to complete the puzzle. As they complete their puzzles talk about the different shapes and colors that they see.

It wouldn’t be a watermelon theme if you didn’t get outside right?!? This sensory exploration activity is one of my favorites. Your child can help you hollow out pieces of the watermelon and then you can assist them by gluing a piece of paper to a pipe cleaner to make their very own boat. Place the boat into a bin of water, you can make multiple boats and race them around the water! 

## Math Activity

Exposing little ones to counting can be done in so many different ways. I love using 1:1 correspondence activities with fun counters. Using these watermelon cards and black beans you will work with your little one to place the correct number onto the card. This activity is easy to prep and is great for brushing up on those counting skills. 

## Science Activity 

![WatermelonToddler]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/Toddler-Watermelon-Sort.jpg)

Your littles will love this hands-on science activity where they get to touch and feel all the parts of the watermelon with this dissection activity. As they take apart the piece of watermelon to separate you can talk to them about the different parts all while teaching them some new vocabulary. I’ll warn you this activity is a bit sticky!

I hope you found some great ideas to use at home with your little ones!
