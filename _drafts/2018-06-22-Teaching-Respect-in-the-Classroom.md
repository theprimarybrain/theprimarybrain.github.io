One of the most important lessons I want my first graders to leave me with at the end of the year is a respect for one another. So many kids today are not taught the importance of respecting authority, their peers, or themselves within their own homes. Therefore, we as teachers have a huge responsibility to teach our littles how to show respect as they go through their daily lives. My students LOVE interactive activities, so I created a [Respect Lapbook](http://bit.ly/2KeDFhq) that goes through the importance of respect.

To create a lapbook, you take one piece of construction paper and fold the two sides together until they meet in the middle. Then, paste the two respect cover strips onto the front of the lapbook. My students always love getting to color in their cover sheets while we discuss what they already know about respect.

Since we study the 5 senses in first grade, this flip book was the perfect fit to integrate science into this lesson. Once my students understand how respect looks, feels, and sounds, it is easier for them to put respect into practice in their own lives.

As a final reflection activity, students will write a narrative piece where they explain what respect means to them in their own words. I love to read these narrative writing pieces
