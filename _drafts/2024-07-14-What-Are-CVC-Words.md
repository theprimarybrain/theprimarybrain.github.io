## What are cvc words?

CVC words are three letter words that follow one simple pattern: consonant-vowel-consonant. CVC words make up some of the earliest words we teach to young learners since they can be read by understanding 5 short vowel sounds and consonant letter sounds. Here are some examples of cvc words that children can begin learning: 

| Short Vowel | CVC Words |
| short a | cat, map, ran, fat |
| short e | red, pet, hen, net |
| short i | pig, lip, fin, sit |
| short o | dog, pot, log, mop |
| short u | cup, bus, sun, nut |

## How to teach children to read cvc words

REWORD: 
Teaching children to read CVC words involves several key strategies. First, focus on individual sounds, helping children to identify the consonant and vowel sounds in each word. Next, practice blending these sounds together to form the complete word. Repetition and practice are essential, so using flashcards, engaging in reading activities, and playing phonics games can reinforce these skills. Encouraging children to recognize patterns and similarities in word families also boosts their confidence and ability to decode new words.
