I love to spend some time after winter break brushing up on the writing strategies that my students NEED! In order for my first graders to be successful at writing paragraphs by the end of the year, they need to be able to expand, combine, and proofread their sentences. 

## Expanding Sentences
In the beginning of the school year, we work on 

When we expand sentences, we work on making them longer by adding an adjective, conjunction, or preposition to the sentence. This helps students add details and make their sentences more exciting!

## Combining Sentences
Learning to combine sentences is such an important skill for our little learners as they begin to write paragraphs. You know those repetitive sentences that our little ones write as they are first learning? 

    I like my cat. I like my mom. I like my dog. I like my ball....
    
You know the ones! Teaching my firsties to combine these sentences using conjunctions always makes their writing more interesting. I always begin by teaching them to take two similar sentences and combine them using the word _and_. Once they can combine using _and_, we move on to other conjunctions to continue to make their writing more interesting.

## Proofreading Sentences
Proofreading is what makes our writing complete! Learning how to add capitalization marks, correct spelling, and add the proper ending mark helps to polish writing as our little learners write final drafts. In my first grade class, I like to have my students write a rough draft in their journals on primary lined paper. This writing paper is so helpful because there are large white space areas between their writing lines. We use this space to add their proofreading marks and make any necessary corrections. 

After editing their writing, it is time to write a final draft! I like to give my students a special paper with a border to write their final drafts on. Then, we add their polished writing to our Writing Wall Bulletin Board.

## Writing Strategies FREEBIE

I want to give you a tool to use as you work on these strategies with your students! This writing intervention freebie includes 3 worksheets that are designed to target the 3 individual writing skills. By explicitly teaching the skill, your students will learn how to apply the skill to their writing. They will also work on proper handwriting as they rewrite their corrected, expanded, and combined sentences.

  window.fd('form', {
    formId: '5ff8b2ef92d9bd264ab3291c',
    containerEl: '#fd-form-5ff8b2ef92d9bd264ab3291c'
  });
</script>
