This week we are diving into kite toddler activities as we learn outside the classroom! There’s nothing like watching a child’s face holding onto a kite as it soars through the air. I created this [Kite Themed Toddler Unit](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Toddler-Activities-Lesson-Plans-Preschool-Kite-Themed-Curriculum-Letter-K-4844775?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Kite%20Toddler%20School%20Unit) to bring a bit of the spring, kite-flying season to you and your little ones!

## Lesson Components 
This unit is made up of 5 lessons that will each work on the following activities:
- literacy/language 
- sensory bin 
- math and science activity 
- fine motor activity 
- gross motor activity 
- art activity 

## Art Activities

This unit includes so many fun kite art activities that I know your littles will adore. It’s also a perfect way to introduce the letter Kk. To kick off the unit, you can make a paper bag kite with your child. This is sure to be a hit, and your little one will be asking you when he or she can go outside to try flying the kite. For this activity, you’ll give your child an open paper bag to decorate however he or she would like. You can use markers, glitter, washi tape, dot markers, or anything else you have on hand that will make your child’s kite extra special. The sky's the limit! Once your child is finished decorating, you’ll punch a very small hole in the bottom of the bag and thread a string through the hole. This will be the top of the kite. Inside the bottom opening of the bag, you can tape colorful streamers inside so that they hang out of the bottom of the kite. Then head outside on a breezy day and enjoy the fresh air and let your child try to fly his or her kite! 
## Fine Motor Activities

Stickers are an awesome (and fun!) way to allow your little one to develop fine motor skills. Fine motor skills are so important because they help strengthen and develop the muscles in our little one’s hands, which in turn will help them with things like holding a pencil, cutting, and gluing. For this activity, you’ll use a kite printable and a sheet of small stickers. Your child will peel the stickers off of the sheet and use them to decorate the kite. The peeling motion is great fine motor practice, and your child will have so much fun decorating a kite! 

## Sensory Bins

Sensory bins are always a household favorite for us and they are a great teaching tool.  Anytime we can add a tactile element to learning, it helps solidify the learning with our little ones. In other words, the more hands-on, the better! Sensory experiences are the perfect way to incorporate hands-on learning! For this sensory bin activity, just fill a bin with a quarter inch of sand. You can use the sand sensory bin cards included in this unit. Your little one will pick up one card and place it inside the bin. Using his or her finger, he or she will write the letter or number shown on the card in the sand. If your child needs assistance, use hand over hand movements to help your child with the correct formation of the letters. Make sure to remind your child of the name of the letter and try to have your child say the letter as he or she writes it in the sand, too. Tip- a plastic pencil box will work great for this activity if you don’t have a large bin. And it has a lid!

For this next sensory bin activity, place cotton balls, or “clouds,” into a bin. Then, mix up the kite puzzle pieces and set them inside the bin with the cotton balls. Your child will search for the puzzle pieces and set the completed pieces outside the bin. As your child finds each puzzle piece, review the name of the shape on the puzzle pieces. Make sure to leave time afterwards to play with and explore the cotton balls! 

## Math Activities

This math activity is the perfect way to review number recognition and counting to four. For this engaging math activity, you will pre-cut the four pieces of the kite cut and paste printable. Your child will use these pieces to glue onto the workmat like a puzzle. As your child completes this activity, make sure to have your child point to each number and say the name, as well as practice counting to four.

For this next math activity, you’ll create a kite using the printable included in the unit. You’ll punch a hole in the bottom of the kite and string a ribbon through the hole to create a tail. Glue the number squares onto clothespins, or handwrite numbers 1-9 onto the clothespins with a permanent marker. Next, your child will clip the numbered clothespins onto the ribbon tail. Review the name of each number with your child as he or she clips the numbers onto the tail of the kite.

For this last math activity, your little one will have fun strengthening his or her fine motor skills while practicing 1:1 counting! First you’ll print and laminate the number bead cards that are included in the unit. Punch a hole in the bottom of the kites. Thread and tie off a pipe cleaner on the bottom of each kite. Then, have your child string beads on each pipe cleaner to match the number on the kite. Don’t forget to have your child count out loud as he or she strings those beads.
