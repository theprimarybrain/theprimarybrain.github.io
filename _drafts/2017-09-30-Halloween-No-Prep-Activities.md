Fall is here! Excitement is growing as pumpkin spice, costumes, and candies fill the aisles EVERYWHERE! And we can't forget the Target mini erasers! I have already indulged in my fair share... #teacherbudgetproblems

Halloween is always one of my student's favorite holidays. Costumes, candy, parties, trick or treating... I mean what's not to love?!? I love to incorporate some Halloween fun through math spiral review activities. For each day of the month, I grab a different math activity to use in math centers, for early finishers, or as math homework.

We worked on graphing through this fun Halloween graphing page. I make sure my students color each item in the box to help them keep track of the items they have added to their graph. After completing their graphs, I had my sweet firsties turn to a partner to share their findings.
