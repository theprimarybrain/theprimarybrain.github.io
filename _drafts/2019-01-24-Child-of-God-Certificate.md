Inside the [Beginner's Bible](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/031075013X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=031075013X&linkCode=as2&tag=theprimarybra-20&linkId=dd6edeaa97a0baf2f410731dd7f7f3ee), there is a wonderful story about how Jesus died on the cross and rose from the grave.  we talked about how Christ paid the price for our sins so that we can go to Heaven when we die. I explained that if we ask Jesus into our hearts, then we become a Child of God and He will be with us wherever we go. He was so excited to pray and ask Jesus to come into his heart! As a parent, there is no greater joy than hearing my child make this choice.
