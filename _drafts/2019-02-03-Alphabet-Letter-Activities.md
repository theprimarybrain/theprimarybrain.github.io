Teaching letters and sounds to children is one of my absolute favorite things to do! There is no better feeling than the moment when a child can identify all letter names and letter sounds. Now you know they are now prepared to blend sounds and learn to read! 

I always have a handful of students who need intervention support with letter name and sound identification. Here are five ways to work on letter names and sounds during a small group rotation. 

### 1. Introducing Letters
If there is a letter that students cannot identify, then I give them a single [letter worksheet page](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Alphabet-Letter-Worksheets-4220898?utm_source=My%20Blog&utm_campaign=Letter%20Name%20and%20Sound%20Intervention) to practice the letter. Each worksheet has the student color and trace the letter, fill in the bubble for each letter, and identify beginning sounds for the letter.

### 3. Uppercase and Lowercase Letter Differentiation
Dot markers are ALL THE RAGE in my classroom. For students who need support with identifying uppercase and lowercase letters, I give them this [ABC Dot Color Uppercase and Lowercase Letter Worksheet](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/ABC-Dot-Color-Uppercase-and-Lowercase-Letter-Worksheets-3829464?utm_source=My%20Blog&utm_campaign=Letter%20Name%20and%20Sound%20Intervention%20Blog%20Post) and two different colored dot markers. For each uppercase letter, students dot in one color. For each lowercase letter, students dot in a second color. 

### 4. Shaving Cream Letters
Hands on activities are SO IMPORTANT in the classroom. Once my students are able to distinguish between letters, I love to spray a little shaving cream on the table and show a flash card for each letter of the alphabet. First, I show the flash card and ask students to say the name of the letter. Second, we say the sound together. Lastly, students can finger write the letters in their shaving cream for letter writing practice. When first beginning this activity, you may choose to introduce each letter in alphabetical order, but once students have shown mastery of some letters, then mix up the cards to practice.
