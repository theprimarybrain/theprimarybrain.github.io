November is such an important time of reflection in the classroom as we think about all the things we are thankful for. I have always done a writing craftivity in November to give my students the opportunity to share what they are thankful for. This year, I wanted to take this a step further so that my students hear their peers share what they are thankful for as well. I added a thankfulness prompt to my November Reflection Prompt Cards because I love to hear my littles share what is most special to their little hearts. I always hear the typical answers such as my family, my friends, my home, my teacher, etc. However, now that my students are accostomed to sharing their heart with our class family, they now open up and share things that you wouldn't expect from a first grader. I am so proud of my littles for opening up and sharing things that are not easy to hear. If it wasn't for my reflection closing circle, I would not know the trials, frustrations, and happy celebrations that my students face every single day. If you want to try out my reflection prompt cards, you can grab my November Relection Prompt Cards. You can also grab my Reflection Prompt Card Bundle if you want to keep reflecting for the whole year.
