I created this [Queen Themed Toddler Unit](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Toddler-Activities-Lesson-Plans-Letter-of-the-Week-Letter-Q-5058042?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Queen%20Toddler%20School%20Unit) to bring a bit of royalty, fun, and learning to your little ones! 

## Lesson Components 

This unit is made up of 5 lessons that will each work on the following activities:
- literacy/language 
- sensory bin 
- math and science activity 
- fine motor activity 
- gross motor activity 
- art activity 

## Art Activities

To start the week off, your little ones will love coloring the queen’s court printables and drawing faces on each one. You can then cut out the faces and glue them onto popsicle sticks. Have fun putting on a puppet show with your little one. Encourage lots of language and pretend play here!

Your little one will also have a blast making a queen’s wand! Your child will decorate the stars with crayons, markers, paint, or whatever fun art supplies you have on hand. Include your child as you cut out the stars and glue them to the craft stick and add ribbon to the want. You can use this fun wand for some of the gross motor activities that are included in this unit as well!  

## Fine Motor Activities

Practicing fine motor skills is important, especially to build strength in those little finger and hand muscles. This jewel gluing activity is perfect practice for this! Your child will use liquid glue to paste jewels onto a crown. The squeezing of the glue bottle is great for building hand strength, and the act of gluing the small jewels to the crown is great for finger coordination and manipulation. For even more fun, glue the crown onto a long piece of paper or sentence strip and let your child wear it!

Dot markers are another great way to practice fine motor skills, and what better way than to dot the queen’s crown!? While working on this activity, make sure to remind your child to dot inside each circle. Have fun decorating the crown. If your child is ready, you can even encourage him or her to create patterns with the dot markers on the crown. 

## Sensory Bins

For this fun sensory bin experience, fill a bin with jewels, sequins, or any other sparkly items you have on hand. You’ll add two empty dishes and the sensory bin letter cards. Assist your child in sorting the uppercase and lowercase letter Qq’s into the correct dishes. Don’t forget to use the letter names as often as possible so your child will begin to recognize the letter Qq. Make sure to provide free time to play and explore the bin before or after sorting the cards.

For this activity, you’ll fill a bin with a thin layer of sand. Your child will draw a card from the pile and practice writing the letter or number shown on the card in the sand using his or her finger. A thin paintbrush is another option to let your child practice correct letter and number formation. This kinetic activity is sure to be a hit while helping your child begin to learn to form numbers and letters! 

## Math Activities

It’s so important to work with our little ones on 1:1 correspondence, and the more hands on the better! In this activity, your child will use play dough snakes to create numerals and play dough balls to match the number on the cards.  It’s fine motor play dough practice and counting practice all rolled into one!

For this fun math activity, your child will use jewels to place on each crown to match the number on each crown. Assist your child as needed and have fun as your child practices recognizing numbers and 1:1 counting.
