One of my favorite projects to do with my students is to create student portfolios to store all of their special work from first grade. If you are anything like me, then you probably have a giant stack of student work that you have saved throughout the school year. Then you get close to Open House and the question becomes *what do I do with all these fantastic projects?*

I love to have my students write an opinion piece about their favorite day in first grade to add to their student journals. It is such a fun piece of writing for parents to read as they first open their child's yearly portfolio.
