Did you know that about 80% of our child's brain develops by the time they are age 3? When I learned this statistic, I quickly realized the importance of teaching age appropriate skills to our toddlers! Teaching our little ones is so fun and rewarding, but it can also be challenging to know what to teach to 2 and 3 year old little ones. To try to make it easier for you, here are 7 skills areas for toddlers that I focus on when planning lessons for my own children:

## Language Development for Toddlers
Our children are sponges! They are taking in everything we say, so it is especially important to be using a variety of vocabulary when speaking to your toddler. 

saying simple words and sentences
## Art Activities for Toddlers

## Fine Motor Skills for Toddlers
drawing, pinching, using a pincer grasp, squeezing

## Sensory Activities for Toddlers
play based activities
teach letters to toddlers
seeing, hearing, tasting, touching, and smelling

## Math Activities for Toddlers
numbers, counting, vocabulary such as big/little, short/long

## Gross Motor Activities for Toddlers
walking, running, jumping, balancing

## Social Activities for Toddlers
playing well with others, taking turns, imaginative fantasy plan
