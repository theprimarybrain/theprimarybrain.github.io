When my oldest son was just 2 years old, I grabbed a cup of hot tea, my favorite flair pen and notebook, and I began to plan out an entire year of toddler activities that I could do with him at home.  My daughter was just 3 weeks old at the time and my son was craving the one on one attention he was used to. I really wanted to create something that he and I could do together every day to give him consistency while baby sister napped. 

And this was the beginning of the most beautiful memories I could have ever imagined as we started our Toddler School Journey! I created my Toddler School Curriculum so that Parents and Teachers could have an easy to follow lesson series that covers all the important skills our little ones need as they learn and grow!

When I thought about what I wanted structured mornings to look like, I knew I wanted a play-based approach to learning so that my son would have fun and enjoy learning! So, I started to think about his interests and the things he loved the most. He loved to play with cars and dinosaurs, so I created toddler school units that focused on these themes.
