## Lesson Setup


We kicked off our unit The first thing I  do with my son at the beginning of a new unit is color our cover page for our unit notebook. I fold a large sheet of construction paper in half and glue the cover page on with stick glue. It's a great way to introduce the new unit while getting in some much needed coloring practice.
