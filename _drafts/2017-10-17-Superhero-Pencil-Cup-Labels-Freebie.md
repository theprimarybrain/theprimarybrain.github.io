 It is day three of my blog launch giveaway series and today I bring you a free classroom management strategy. Sometimes I have nightmares at night about all the wasted time my students spend when they can't find materials. You know the one... The student who sits at his desk doing *absolutely nothing* because they can't find a pencil. To win the pencil war in my classroom, I allow students to take a sharpened pencil anytime they need one as long as they return a dull pencil. So far this year, I have not had any students take advantage of the out of seat time, but I will keep my _fingers crossed_! You can grab my [**superhero pencil cup labels freebie in my TpT Store**!](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Superhero-Themed-Pencil-Sharpened-and-Unsharpened-LabelsSigns-3237664) Make sure to check out my full [**Superhero Decor Pack**](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Superhero-Themed-Classroom-Decor-Pack-BUNDLE-3255953) for lots of other great superhero themed resources.
