My students love working on writing blends and digraphs through this fun [Blends and Digraphs Write and Wipe Activity](http://bit.ly/2GPzKTo)! Once my students master the ability to read and write CVC words, then we move on to introducing blends and digraphs. After introducing the sounds, I put these activity mats into their literacy center rotations. Each student will pull a card, say the word, write the word, and use the word in a sentence. When students are able to complete the activity mat with accuracy, I offer challenges to extend their learning. For example, I may challenge to combine two word cards into a sentence or write an extended sentence with a prepositional phrase, adjective, or conjunction. 

### How to Implement in Your Classroom

All you need to complete this activity is a sheet protector, write and wipe mat, word cards, and an expo marker. To complete the workmat, each student will grab a vocabulary word card and place in the blank square on their workmat. Next, they will write the word using the box at the top. I like to have students segment each sound on their fingers before writing in the box. Once they complete the word, students will write a simple or extended sentence using the word, depending on their ability level. It helps my struggling writers to have sentence frames to choose from.
