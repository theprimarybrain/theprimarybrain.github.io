Before you even begin to organize your small group reading groups, let's talk about materials management, because this is key to saving your sanity! I have tried a few different systems over the years, but my favorite has been using a labeled 6 drawer Iris tower. You are likely working with multiple groups of kids who are all at different reading levels, which means you will need a wide array of materials to focus on the skills that each of your students need. So, before you even begin to prep your copies and assemble materials, do yourself a favor and take a moment to find the way that works the best for you to organize materials. 

Each of the groups I meet with have a color name, so I can call out the "green group" and have them all come to the small group table to work with me in a matter of seconds. I even added [these labels](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Black-and-Brights-EDITABLE-Bin-Labels-Classroom-Decor-3371262?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Sterilite%20bin%20labels) so I could keep everything I need for each group inside the drawer. This way, I don't waste any transition time grabbing materials.
