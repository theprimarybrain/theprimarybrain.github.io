Before you even begin to organize your small group reading groups, let's talk about materials management, because this is key to saving your sanity! You are likely working with multiple groups of kids who are all at different reading levels, which means you will need a wide array of materials to focus on the skills that each of your students need. So, before you even begin to prep your copies and assemble materials, take a moment to find the way that works the best for you to organize materials. 

## My Favorite System
I have tried a few systems over the years, but my favorite way to keep everything at my fingertips is with this [6 drawer tower](https://amzn.to/44siyNI).

Each of the groups I meet with have a color name, so I can call out the "green group" and have them all come to the small group table to work with me in a matter of seconds. I even added [these labels](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Black-and-Brights-EDITABLE-Bin-Labels-Classroom-Decor-3371262?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Sterilite%20bin%20labels) so I could keep everything I need for each group inside the drawer. This way, I don't waste any transition time grabbing materials.
