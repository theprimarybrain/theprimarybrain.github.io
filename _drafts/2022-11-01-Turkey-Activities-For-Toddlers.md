Gobble, gobble! It’s time for the letter T! I absolutely love everything about Thanksgiving, like the turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, and of course, the pumpkin pie! So when I was trying to figure out some educational activities to go along with my [Toddler School Curriculum](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Toddler-Activities-Lesson-Plans-Tot-School-Curriculum-Homeschool-Preschool-4296281?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Toddler%20Bundle%20Upsell), I just couldn’t resist turkey activities since turkey and Thanksgiving both start with the letter T!
