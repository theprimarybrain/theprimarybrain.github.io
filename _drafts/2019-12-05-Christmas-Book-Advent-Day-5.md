Today is one of my favorite days in December!! It is the day we go to a Christmas tree lot and pick out our very own Christmas tree! I never understood the magic behind a real tree until I was married and experienced the smell a real tree brings into a home. Now that we have children, there is something so special about putting on some boots and going to pick out a tree. This is one of my favorite family traditions and I am so happy to share it with my children. 

For our Christmas Book Advent today, we read the book [Pick a Pine Tree](https://amzn.to/33DdqqJ). It was perfect! The book is filled with such rich vocabulary and taught my preschooler so many words he didn't know. This book will be perfect in my first grade classroom for a lesson about adjectives!

## Family Activity

Pack up your family and head out to purchase a Christmas tree. Even if you have a fake tree in your home, it is still so much fun for children to experience the magic of picking out a tree. You can always grab a mini tree and place in a separate room in your home. My son loves to pick out a 3 foot tree that he gets to decorate himself. We have found great ones in tree lots and at grocery stores! I hope you enjoy the sweet smells of Christmas as you pick out a tree!
