Let's get ready to count down to the new year with our little ones! I am planning a New Years Eve celebration with my kids at home this year and we will be using all of the activities in my [New Years Toddler School Pack](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/50-off-48-Hours-New-Years-Toddler-School-Activities-Preschool-Lesson-Plans-10712273?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=New%20Years%20Toddler%20Post). We will be kicking off the fun in the early morning and counting down the hours until noon when we will countdown to the New Years at the stroke of noon, since that is the only 12:00 my littles will be seeing this year!

## Kick Off the New Year's Celebration

[![NewYearToddlerSensoryBin]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/new-years-toddler-book.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/50-off-48-Hours-New-Years-Toddler-School-Activities-Preschool-Lesson-Plans-10712273?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=New%20Years%20Toddler%20Post)

To begin our day of fun, we will be reading our Happy New Year Book and making a party hat! This book includes a variety of vocabulary words that you can teach to your little ones.

After reading, you can have your child color the picture to create a party hat that they can wear all day long!

## New Years Sensory Bins for Toddlers

[![NewYearToddlerSensoryBin]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/new-years-toddler-sensory-bin.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/50-off-48-Hours-New-Years-Toddler-School-Activities-Preschool-Lesson-Plans-10712273?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=New%20Years%20Toddler%20Post)

Nothing gets my little ones more excited about learning than digging their fingers into a sensory bin! In this bin, we are working on number identification and counting to 5 by celebrating with balloons! Your child will enjoy finding balloons and matching to each card. Then, they can paste the balloons onto the strings to create each bunch.

This next sensory bin combines fun with fine motor skills! To create this frozen sensory bin, you will need to freeze some sequins or glitter in a container with 1/2" of water until frozen. Then, pop out the frozen brick and place in a bin. Pair with some tools for your child to use to break up the ice block and capture the sparkles. You can use a wooden crab mallet, plastic tweezers, a paintbrush, or any other tools you have on hand. 

## New Years Math Activities for Toddlers

In this activity, we are working on patterns by pasting an item onto the strip to complete the pattern. As your child looks at each strip, give lots of opportunities to practice saying the new vocabulary words they are learning throughout this unit. 

## New Year's Fine Motor Activities

No set of toddler activities is complete without our favorite fine motor activities!
