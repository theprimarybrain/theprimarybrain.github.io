Let's get ready to count down to the new year with our little ones! I am planning a New Years Eve celebration with my kids at home this year and we will be using all of the activities in my [New Years Toddler School Pack](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/50-off-48-Hours-New-Years-Toddler-School-Activities-Preschool-Lesson-Plans-10712273?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=New%20Years%20Toddler%20Post). We will be kicking off the fun in the early morning and counting down the hours until noon when we will countdown to the New Years at the stroke of noon, since that is the only 12:00 my littles will be seeing this year!

## Lesson Components 
This unit is made up of 12 activities that include:
- literacy/language 
- sensory bins 
- math activities
- fine motor activities
