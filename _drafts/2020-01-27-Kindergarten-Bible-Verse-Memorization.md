Growing up, I loved learning Bible verses. I was always so excited to highlight the verses in my Bible that I had learned. I have always loved the idea of teaching Bible verses to children, but I knew I needed a plan that would help students not only memorize the scriptures, but commit the Bible verses to their hearts. I created my Bible Verse Memorization Packs to do just that! 

Each week, children will focus on one Bible verse. There are 4 days of activities and an assessment for the 5th day. We learn through repetition, so practicing the same verse every day in different ways will help children to remember the verses.
