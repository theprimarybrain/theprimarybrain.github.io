  You guys... I found my absolute favorite activity to teach my students about teamwork. Working as a team can be HARD, and this little activity taught the importance of teamwork in a big way. I gave each table group a ball of "spider web" from Oriental Trading Company. The goal of the activity was to work together to stretch this ball of cotton into a spider web that stretched evenly across the entire set of desks. My students quickly learned that if one person pulls harder on the strand than the rest of the students, the spider web would tear and all their hard work would need to be repeated. It was the perfect message to drive home that all students must give equal contributions to their team when completing a task in order to their best. 


  Nothing was more exciting for my littles than getting to bedazzle the spider at the end of the day. I filled paint palletes with washable tempura paint for my students to use to paint the spider. The paint went on so easily and made a huge statement. 

  Then, I gave my students liquid glue to use to add sequins, glitter, pom pom balls, and jewels to the spider skeleton. This was not a sight for sore eyes. 

  To close out our incredibly fun spider theme day, I had my students write about what they would do if they were a spider for the day. I also gave an alternate choice where students could write about what they would do if they walked into class and found out that their teacher was a spider. This was a great activity for fast finishers, too.
