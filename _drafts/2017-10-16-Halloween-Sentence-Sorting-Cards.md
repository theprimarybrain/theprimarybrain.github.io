It is day two of my blog launch giveaway series and I hope you are doing a _happy dance_ with me! Today I bring you Halloween Themed Sentence Sorting Cards. Many of my students this year are struggling to write sentences independently. I created a resource to help them form a sentence by putting the cards in order. After sorting, students use their writing recording page to copy the sentences. This provides a visual for my struggling readers and writers to copy.

This also gives me a quick glance at their capitalization, spacing, proper letter formation, and ending marks. You can grab my [**Halloween Sentence Sorting Cards here**!]() You can also check out my [**Scrambled Sentences Writing Formation Activity**](http://bit.ly/2xzzjMr) for sentences you can use at any time of the year.
