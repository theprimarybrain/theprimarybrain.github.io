It is day two of my blog launch giveaway series and I hope you are doing a _happy dance_ with me! Today I bring you Halloween Themed Sentence Sorting Cards. Many of my students this year are struggling to write sentences independently. I created a resource to help them form a sentence by putting the cards in order. After sorting, students use their writing recording page to copy the sentences. This gives my struggling readers and writers a visual to copy. This gives me a quick assessment to see if they are remembering capitalization, spacing, proper letter formation, and ending marks. You can grab my [Halloween Sentence Sorting Cards here!]() You can also check out my [Scrambled Sentences Writing Formation Activity](http://bit.ly/2xzzjMr) if you enjoy this activity and need additional sentences.
