As a teacher, I always feel like we have a huge responsibility to make sure my first graders create a special and memorable Mother's Day gift to give to their sweet Mommas. My students are always so excited this time of year to channel their creativity into the perfect gift. Mother's Day Lapbooks are the perfect gift because my littles are able to showcase their writing and artistic skills while writing really sweet and thoughtful notes in this lap-sized card.
