When I first started teaching, it was so overwhelming to figure out what to teach during each of my small groups. A group of 5-6 kids would sit down at my horseshoe table and I had a solid 15-20 minutes to work with these kids on the phonics skills they were struggling with. It often felt like I was running the hamster wheel trying to pull resources to target all the skills they needed. 

After a couple years, I found a system that really worked for me and I am excited to share it with you, too! But first, if you haven't already assessed your students and formed your groups, then you can read more about how I assess my students AND grab a free phonics assessment in this blog post ([click here for the post!](https://theprimarybrain.com/small%20group%20reading/2023/08/22/Phonics-Skills-Assessment/)).

## How to Store Materials
Before you even begin to prep your copies and assemble materials, take a moment to find the way that works the best for you to organize materials. My favorite way to keep everything at my fingertips is with this [6 drawer tower]().

Each of the groups I meet with have a color name, so I can call out the "green group" and have them all come to the small group table to work with me in a matter of seconds. I even added [these labels](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Black-and-Brights-EDITABLE-Bin-Labels-Classroom-Decor-3371262?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Sterilite%20bin%20labels) so I could keep everything I need for each group inside the drawer. This way, I don't waste any transition time grabbing materials.
