One of my favorite things to do on the first day of school is read picture books to my students. Reading a book to my new students is a great way to help them stay calm and feel welcomed into our classroom on the first day.

First Day Jitters is my all-time favorite children's book! After our first morning meeting on the first day of school, I always read this book to my students. It is about a girl who is too scared to go to school with a silly twist at the end. The girl just happens to be the teacher! This book always leaves my students roaring with laughter at the thought of a teacher being so silly! After reading the book I always notice that my students seem much more comfortable being in our class. This is the perfect time to grab a quick writing sample from my students by having them write about their own first day jitters. You can grab this and many other first day worksheets in my First and Last Day of School Worksheet Pack.

After we finish writing, we come back together for a fun drink of jitter juice! I make the jitter juice with sprite and some sprinkles. We just shake the sprinkles to shake the jitters away!

After lunch, I usually have a few students who start to miss their parents. We read The Kissing Hand and it helps them feel a lot better.

Send me a message on social media with your favorite picture books for the first day of school. I am always looking for new favorites!
