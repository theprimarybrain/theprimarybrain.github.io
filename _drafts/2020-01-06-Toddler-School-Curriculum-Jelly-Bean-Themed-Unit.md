Easter is such a fun time of year for toddlers as they play and learn throughout their day. My son was so excited for all of the Easter bunnies, jelly beans, and Easter eggs. So, I put together this fun [Jelly Bean Themed Toddler School Unit](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Toddler-Lesson-Plans-Jelly-Bean-Themed-Lessons-4886650?utm_source=TPB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Jelly%20Bean%20Toddler%20School%20Post)! Here are a few fun activities from the unit that you can do at home with your little ones. 

To kick off the unit, we started out with a Jelly Bean Sensory Bin. This bin was created for a fun sensory experience where a child can play with the jelly beans and the tools along with it. This bin provided hours of fun for my little guy while I prepped a few of the other activities for the unit!
