Are your kiddos anxious to get to the zoo?!?! I know that Conner is and he cannot wait to see the elephants! I created this elephant themed toddler unit to bring a little piece of the zoo to you and your littles!! 

## Lesson Components

This unit is made up of 5 lessons that will work on each include the following activities:
-literacy/language
-sensory bin
-math or science activity
-fine motor activity
-gross motor activity
-art activity

## Art Activities 

Toddler-Elephant-Painting.jpg

To kick off our unit on elephants we started with Conner’s favorite thing...painting! He was so excited to tell me everything he knew about elephants while using his imagination to paint his own! I gave him a couple different colors and a paintbrush and he dove right in! The fun in art for littles is the process and Conner was so proud of his finished product! 

## Fine Motor Activities

I LOVE activities that work on fine motor skills, I know being a teacher makes me a little biased about this topic but perfecting these skills at a young age is SO important and it's easy to do!
Toddler-Elephant-Dot-Marker-Letter-E.jpg

Dot markers are a favorite in our household!!! They are quick and easy to use while working on fine motor and literacy. We practiced our letter E sound  Conner focused so hard on staying inside each dot...don’t you love seeing them so determined???? 

Toddler-Elephant-Fine-Motor-Clip-Cards.jpg

This one is great because it works the muscles and the brain! In this activity we used clothespins and clip cards to match the big and little e! Perfect for letter identification while using those tiny little muscles to build up those fine motor skills. 

Toddler-Elephant-Fine-Motor-Qtip.jpg

I wasn’t kidding when I said we did a ton of fine motor activities during this unit!! To set this activity up just grab any color paint and a couple Qtips with the letter E printable. Conner worked so so hard to keep his dots inside the E. Q-tips are great for building smaller muscles because the kiddos use a fine grip to hold the qtip to paint. 

Toddler-Elephant-Fine-Motor-Scissors-Skill.jpg

OK! So I really do love fine motor activities and this is why....scissors! Conner used the scissors to cut up a line to reach the elephant and he did need a little bit of help from me.
Proper scissor skills are SO important for our littles as they get older it takes both hands and coordination to master this. I know using scissors with the younger kiddos makes us teachers and parents a little anxious but all they need is some assistance and just practice practice practice!  

## Math Activities 

Toddler-Elephant-Counting-Cards.jpg

For our math activity we worked on our counting and number identification with these printable counting cards! Conner chose little erasers but any counter will work!! Fun and easy way to develop those math skills!

## Sensory Activities 

Toddler-Elephant-Feed-Sensory-Bin.jpg

I love sensory exploration just as much as Conner does!!!! For this one you will want to grab an empty water bottle to attach the elephant face then add some pom poms and throw in some little tweezers. Your little one is going to love feeding the elephant and it engages those fine motor muscles that we have been working so hard on!!!! I had to pull out some other activities to get Conner to take a break from this one!! 

Toddler-Elephant-Sensory-Bin-Letter-Sorting.jpg

Sensory bins are such a great introduction to letter identification! To practice letter E we used the elephant big and little e cards in a bin of rice! Sensory bins are great because they are super easy to throw together!!

## Gross Motor Activities 

Toddler--Elephant-Gross-Motor-Bear-Walk.jpg

We worked so hard today we had to get outside! This elephant walk is WAY harder than it looks. Start by laying these elephant footprints down in a line then get onto all fours to walk like an elephant. We really tested our coordination skills plus we had so much fun practicing our elephant noises...it definitely sounded like the zoo in our backyard!!!!!

This unit includes everything you need to make teaching your toddlers about elephants EASY! I hope you have fun playing and learning with your little ones!!! Check out my (elephant toddler school unit)
