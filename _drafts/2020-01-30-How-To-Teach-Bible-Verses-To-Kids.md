Have you ever wondered how to teach Bible verses to your children or students? The idea of teaching Bible verses to children has always been at the forefront of my mind. However, when I set out to do this, I knew I needed a plan that would help kids not only memorize the scriptures, but commit the Bible verses to their hearts. If we want to encourage our children to grow in their relationships with the Lord, then we need to give them the tools to do this. One way to help our children grow in their faith is to teach them to memorize scriptures that they can hide in their sweet little hearts. I created Bible Verse Memorization Packs to do just that! 

This series of Bible Verse Memorization Packs is broken into Kindergarten, First Grade, Second Grade, and Third Grade, so you can embark on a four year journey to help your children memorize Bible verses in a meaningful way. 

Each week, children will focus on one Bible verse. Each grade level contains verses appropriate for the age, while following a similar format. There are 4 days of activities with an assessment on the 5th day. Children learn through repetition, so practicing the same verse each day in a different way will help children to remember the verses.

All Bible Verse Memorization Packs include a bible verse journal that students will add to each week. It includes a cut and paste Bible verse that students will glue in. This journal is excellent for reviewing verses that have been learned and as a reminder of how far they have come over the year.

This Kindergarten Bible Verse Memorization Pack includes 20 weeks of Bible verses to help young learners begin to memorize scripture. The verses begin with very simple verses made up of two or more words. In Kindergarten, children will work through three weekly practice pages with an assessment on the final day.
