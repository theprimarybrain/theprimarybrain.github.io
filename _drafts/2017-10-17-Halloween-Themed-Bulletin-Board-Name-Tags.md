Today is the 3rd day of my blog launch giveaway and so I thought I would help you spruce up those Halloween bulletin boards that still need a little something. I created Halloween name tags to place below student artwork in my hallways. My students work so hard on their work and I wanted a special name card to show it off. Head on over to TpT to grab my [Halloween Student Name Tags freebie](http://bit.ly/2gjXIOC)! Be sure to check out all seven days of my blog launch giveaway!
