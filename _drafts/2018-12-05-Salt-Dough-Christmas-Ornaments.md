Ingredients
- 2 1/3 cups all purpose flour
- 1 cup salt
- 2 tsp. cinnamon 
- 1 cup warm water
- 2 tsp. molasses

Directions
1. Combine 2 cups of the flour, cinnamon and salt in a large mixing bowl. 
2. Add warm water and molasses to the bowl. Use a spatula to combine.
3. Knead dough using your hands to form a smooth ball. If the dough is still too sticky, add additional flour until the dough is the correct texture. (I used 2 1/4 cups of flour total.)
4. Use a rolling pin to roll out dough to just under 1/4".
5. Press cookie cutters into the dough. 
6. Pull off the remaining dough. Roll out the dough again and repeat the above process until all cookies are formed.
7. Lay all cookies on a nonstick sheet on a sheet pan. 
8. Press a straw or other round object into the top of each cookie. Don't go too close to the edge!
9. Bake in a 200 degree Farenheit oven for 2 hours, or leave out to air dry for several days. 
10. Paint with watercolor or acrylic paint. Let dry. 
11. Add a string through the hole at the top of each ornament. 
12. Hang on the tree or give as a gift!
