Now that I have two young children, I am always trying to think of new activities to enjoy during Christmas. I was chatting over coffee with some friends from church and one shared a Christmas Book Advent tradition that her family enjoys each year. Each day during December, her kids are given a Christmas book. The collection of books is reused each year, with a few new titles she finds each year. I am so excited to do this at home as well as a version with my classroom family!

Our family already has an entire collection of Christmas books that I read to my kids each Christmas season, so what better idea than to turn this into a Christmas Book Advent for our little family! My favorite part of this tradition is reusing the books that you read each year and rewrapping to create a new excitement for each story of the day. Plus, it is a great way to enjoy wonderful Christmas memories without having to spend much money each year. 

I put together all of the books we will be reading this year to give you a few book ideas to purchase in case you need to round out your current library of Christmas books to pull this off! Each day this month, I will be sharing the book of the day that I am reading with my children as well as an activity, conversation, or game that we will be using to extend the fun.

My hope with our Christmas Book Advent is that this will become a tradition that can be passed on by my children to their children. There is nothing more special than reading books to my kids that my mom read to me growing up.  I know, I know... Slow down Laurin, but one can dream right?!?! Make sure to check back each day for our book pick of the day and a fun activity, conversation, or game to go with it! You can fill out this form to join my email list and receive an email from me each day letting you know about the book of the day! I hope you enjoy new memories with your little ones this year!
