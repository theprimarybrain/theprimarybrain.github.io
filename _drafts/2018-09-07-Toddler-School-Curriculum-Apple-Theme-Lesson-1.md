I am so excited to share this amazing journey of toddler learning that I have embarked on with my son! This past week we started toddler school in our home. My son is 2 1/2 and is the perfect age for working on pre-academic skills that will help prepare him for kindergarten and beyond. For our first unit of study, I created an [Apple Themed Unit](http://bit.ly/toddlerapple). 

## Lesson Components
Each of the 5 lessons in this unit includes the following activities:
- literacy/language
- math or science activity
- fine motor activity
- gross motor activity
- art activity
- recipe/snack

## Day One: Field Trip Day!

I really wanted the first day of learning to fill my little guy with an excitement for learning, so we took a field trip to buy apples from the grocery store. He was so excited to get to help pick out the apples and put them in our shopping bags. We talked about the names, colors, shape, smell, and sizes of each apple as we compared the fruit in the store. I made sure to buy red, green, and yellow apples to use in our lessons.

## Lesson One Activities

After shopping for apples, we dove right into learning about apples! To begin the first lesson, we colored the cover page for our unit notebook. Then, we learned about the letter A and colored an "A is for apple" coloring page. 

![Sensory Bin]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/toddler-apple-pie-sensory-bin-play.jpg)
Sensory play and exploration is so important for the toddler age. Allowing your child to use his or her imagination during a hands-on activity will engage the child and help him reach his full potential. I created this Apple Pie Sensory Bin to work on "big A" and "little a" through sensory play. My son would not stop playing for a full hour! 

![Math Cards]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/toddler-apple-poms-number-match.jpg)
To work on number skills, we added pom pom "apples" to these apple trees. Most children at this age will need support to count the apples, but can add the apples to the trees independently.

![Playdoh 3]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/toddler-apple-poms-number-match.jpg)

To work on fine motor skills, we rolled playdoh and placed the playdoh on the letters A and a in a sheet protector. First, teach your child to roll the playdoh into "snakes" and then place on the letters. This playdoh mat also makes for a great busy bag activity that can be pulled out at anytime for your toddler!

I hope you are feeling inspired to begin toddler school with your little ones! Stay tuned for the next four lessons! All printables and full lesson plans are available in my [Toddler School Curriculum - Apple Themed Lessons](http://bit.ly/toddlerapple) on Teachers Pay Teachers!
