Are your little ones ready for a wild adventure of learning and playing? I know mine were so excited about this monkey themed unit! I created this [Monkey Themed Toddler Unit](ADD MONKEY UTM CODE HERE) to bring a little bit of adventure and fun to your learning! 
## Lesson Components 
This unit is made up of 5 lessons that will each work on the following activities:
- literacy/language 
- sensory bin 
- math and science activity 
- fine motor activity 
- gross motor activity 
- art activity 
## Art Activities 


![MonkeyToddler]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/Monkey-Toddler-Art.jpg)
This first art activity to kick off this monkey unit is sure to be a hit! There were lots of squeals of joy when we painted little hands to make this adorable monkey handprint art. While doing this art activity, we talked all about the colors of the paint and how it feels on our hands to help develop oral language. We also talked all about our letter of the week and how Mm is for monkey!

For this activity, you’ll have your little color and decorate the printable monkey illustrations. If your child is ready, he or she can cut them out. After cutting, help your child glue the pictures onto popsicle sticks. To extend this activity, we drew a jungle scene on paper to use as a puppet show backdrop. Finally, have fun talking and laughing as your child uses the monkey puppets for a puppet show! This is great oral language development and is also great for imaginative play. 
## Fine Motor Activities 

![MonkeyToddler]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/Monkey-Toddler-Lacing.jpg)

Lacing is great fine motor practice for little hands. It takes stamina to get the string through those holes, and your child will be so proud after completing this monkey lacing activity. You will prep the monkey printable by cutting it out, laminating, and punching the holes around the monkey. Then your child will use a shoelace or piece of yarn to lace through each hole of the monkey. If you use yarn, make sure to glue or tape the end of the yarn ahead of time to avoid the yarn fraying.

Cutting is another skill that our littles need lots of practice with to build confidence and master the skill. In this activity, your child will cut with kid scissors along the dashed lines up to the monkey. Make sure to offer hand over hand practice and show your child how to hold the paper appropriately with the “helping hand” while your child is getting the hang of it! 
## Sensory Bins 

![MonkeyToddler]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/Monkey-Toddler-Sensory-Bin.jpg)
For this monkey sensory bin activity, you’ll fill a bin with pinto beans, google eyes, and the monkey face printable pieces. Have fun with your child while building monkeys. This sensory experience will lend itself to lots of oral language, laughs, and exploration! 

![MonkeyToddler]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/Monkey-Toddler-Sensory-Bin-Letters.jpg)
To switch up the sensory bin, add two empty dishes and the letter cards to the bin. Place an uppercase M and a lowercase m into the dishes. Help your child as needed as he or she searches for letter cards and places them in the correct dish. As your child is working, make sure to include language with “big M” and “little m.” Don’t forget to provide extra time for free play and exploration of the bin!

For this final sensory bin activity, you’ll add the monkey counting cards inside a bin filled with pinto beads. Your child will use the sensory bin counting work and. They’ll pick a card from the bin, count the monkeys on the card, and then place the matching number on the workmat! This is a great sensory bin activity combined with counting practice! 
## Math Activity 

![MonkeyToddler]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/Monkey-Toddler-Math-Puzzles.jpg)
For this fun math activity, you’ll cut out the puzzle pieces and mix them up. Help your child as needed with counting the monkeys on the cards and find the matching number on the other puzzle pieces. Your child will be so proud to find matches and practice oral counting as well as 1:1 counting. 
## Science Activity 

![MonkeyToddler]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/Monkey-Toddler-Memory.jpg)
My kids love the game, Memory! They ask to play it over and over, so this was a fun and easy way to incorporate a little science and language to match our monkey theme this week. To play, just set out the cards face down. Turn over two cards at a time to see if they match. Keep playing until all matching parts are found. As you play, make sure to discuss the attributes of each monkey with your child- color, size, shape, etc. Your child is sure to have fun and enjoy the real photographs of the monkeys on the cards! 
## Gross Motor Activity 

![MonkeyToddler]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/Monkey-Toddler-Gross-Motor.jpg)
For this gross motor activity, set up the monkey maze by drawing three chalk lines in an outside area. You can also use yarn to make an inside maze, if necessary. Your child will follow the maze to find the missing bananas! Make sure your child picks up each banana along the maze path and feed it to the monkey at the end of the maze. Repeat for each line drawn in the maze and have fun!
