Sensory bins are all the rage these days since they provide a fun and interactive way for children to explore their senses and learn about the world around them. Not only can sensory bins hold the attention of our little ones for hours, but they can also assist in the development of fine motor skills, language development, problem-solving skills, and self-regulation. So let's dive right into the world of sensory bins and talk about some ideas for creating sensory bins that are engaging and educational for your little ones:

### Let's Set Up a Sensory Bin

The first thing you will need to do to set up a sensory bin is to grab your favorite bin. We love to use Large Sterilite Bins since they come with a lid and can be easily stored and stacked together. 

Now that you have a bin in hand, you will want to fill it with a sensory bin filler. The sky really is the limit when creating a sensory bin, so here are a few of our favorite sensory bin fillers:
- rice
- beans
- sand
- water beads
- rolled oats
- crinkled paper

### Make It Interactive!
Once your bin is filled with your favorite filler, you will add some tools to create a fun learning experience for your little ones! Here are a few things you may already have on hand:
- plastic tweezers
- scoops
- spoons
- whisks
- bowls
- measuring cups
- measuring spoons
- spatulas

### Set the Stage for Success
