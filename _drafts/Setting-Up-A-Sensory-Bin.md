### How Do I Set Up a Sensory Bin?

First, you will grab your favorite bin. We love to use Large Sterilite Bins since they come with a lid and can be easily stored and stacked together. Then, you will fill the bin with a sensory bin filler. Our favorite fillers include:
- rice
- beans
- sand
- water beads
- rolled oats
- crinkled paper

Once your bin is filled, you will add some tools to create a fun learning experience for your little ones! I love to include tools such as scoops, plastic tweezers, bowls, spoons, funnels, and cups. You can even add in academic components to create a bin that is tailored to your child's age and interests.
