Today is day five of my blog launch giveaway. I have been busy getting ready for the best Halloween at school that my first graders could ever ask for. We love playing I Have Who Has games in my classroom so I created a Halloween version to reinforce the vocabulary words we have been learning this month.

The game begins when I student reads "I have the first card. Who has bat?" The student who has the word "bat" on their card stands up and reads the entire card. The game continues until a student reads the last card. While going through the cards, I like to have my students place their cards under our document camera. This way we can follow the cards and everyone has a chance to see the vocabulary words and pictures.
