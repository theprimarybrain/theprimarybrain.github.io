Valentine's Day is right around the corner and we are filling our days with painting, sensory bins, and all the fine motor activities our hearts desire! These 7 Valentine's Day activities for toddlers are sure to keep your little ones engaged in learning as we enjoy the month of love! Just grab a few materials and you will be ready to play and learn with your little ones!

## Lesson Components 
This unit is made up of 12 valentine activities you can use for the entire month of February:
- literacy and language activities
- sensory bins 
- math activities
- fine motor activities
- art activities

## Art Activities 
Little ones LOVE to create art for their parents, grandparents, and other special people in their lives. In this unit, we made two different art projects that can be turned into cards for Valentine's Day!

All you need for this fingerprint tree is this [tree printable from our Valentine Unit](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Valentine-Toddler-School-Lesson-Plans-Preschool-Activities-8868463?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Valentine%20Toddler%20School) and some liquid paint on a plate. Then, kids will tip their fingertips in the paint and press around the tree to make leaves. When finished, you can cut out the tree and paste onto a large piece of construction paper for a jumbo size card!

In this second craft, we combined fine motor skills and art to make another fun keepsake! First, we tore colored paper into small "pieces" and then glued onto our printable from our [Valentine Toddler School Unit](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Valentine-Toddler-School-Lesson-Plans-Preschool-Activities-8868463?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Valentine%20Toddler%20School). As my daughter pasted on each piece of paper, we talked about all the people she loves and cares about in her life. It was a great way to tie in a conversation about the reasons why each person is special!

## Sensory Bins
Any time I get out the sensory bins in our house, my kids come running! They love to feel each piece of sensory bin filler and dig their hands into a fun learning opportunity. For Valentine's Day, I put together opportunities to work on letter names and sounds and a math matching bin. Take a look at how I set up our sensory bins in this video:

### Candy Heart Letter Name and Sounds Sensory Bin

In this bin, we used crinkled paper as our sensory bin filler and added candy heart letter cards. As children pick up each card, they can practice saying the name and/or sound for each letter, then place it in their candy heart box. We added in some extra practice by saying the name of each letter as we placed back in the sensory bin for next time. 

### Valentine's Day Math Sensory Bin

In this second bin, we built cupcakes by matching numbers! First, I cut out the pieces of each cupcake. You can find the printable pieces in our [Valentine Toddler School Unit](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Valentine-Toddler-School-Lesson-Plans-Preschool-Activities-8868463?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Valentine%20Toddler%20School). Then, my kids picked up one piece at a time from the bin. Depending on the ability level of your child, you could start with the pieces for just a couple cupcakes, or add in all six at once.

## Fine Motor Fun

Playdough is always a hit in our house! In this activity, I created vocabulary cards so we could work on the names of various Valentine's Day symbols that may encounter in our daily lives this month. Then, we rolled snakes and balls of dough and used them to build the symbols. 

Playing with playdough from a young age is an excellent way to build up the tiny hand muscles in little hands. This will help your child's fine motor skill development as they prepare to start writing in Kindergarten!
