Hello Teacher Friends! 

My name is Laurin Brainard and I am a first grade teacher in Southern California. I am currently in my fifth year of teaching. I have been so blessed to teach all five years in my same first grade classroom! Before I started teaching first grade, I was an intervention teacher for struggling readers. For the past two years I have been fortunate to share a teaching contract. This allows me to work half the week and be a mommy at home the other half. I really do experience the best of both worlds!

I was born and raised in Southern California where I now live with my amazing husband and sweet son. When I am not teaching, you will find me spending time with my family, playing in my kitchen, creating new products for my TpT store, and blogging to my heartâ€™s content.
