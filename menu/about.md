Hello Teacher Friends! Welcome to my blog! I'm Laurin Brainard and I am a first grade teacher in Southern California. I am so glad you stopped by!

Ever since I was a little girl, I have known that I wanted to be a teacher. I used to set up all my stuffed animals and "teach" them. This later turned into using my trusty Crayola crayons to draw curriculum for my 4 year old sister. She may not have been as engaged as I wanted her to be, but it was great practice! 

I am now in my 7th year teaching first grade in the same classroom where my teaching journey began! Before I started teaching first grade, I was an intervention teacher for struggling readers. For the past three years I have been fortunate to share a teaching contract. This allows me to work half the week and be a mommy at home the other half. I really do experience the best of both worlds!

I was born and raised in Southern California where I now live with my amazing husband, son and daughter. When I am not teaching, you will find me spending time with family, going to church, playing in my kitchen, homeschooling for preschool, writing curriculum, and blogging to my heartâ€™s content.
