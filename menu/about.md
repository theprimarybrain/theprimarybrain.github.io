Hello Teacher Friend! Welcome to The Primary Brain! 

![LaurinsHeadshot]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/Laurins Headshot_0133.jpg)

I'm Laurin and I am here to help preschool through first grade parents and teachers find the resources and strategies you need to be successful in teaching in your students and young children. 

Maybe you are here looking for phonics, reading, centers, or hands-on preschool activities. If so, I have you covered! My goal at The Primary Brain is to provide busy teachers and parents with the resources you need to keep your little learners engaged all day long, while also saving you time!

## A Little About Laurin...

Ever since I was a little girl, I have known that I wanted to be a teacher. I used to set up all my stuffed animals and "teach" them. This later turned into using my trusty crayons to draw curriculum for my 4 year old sister.

Since then, I have taught first grade for 8 years in Southern California. I was also an intervention teacher for struggling readers. I now have the great priviledge of homeschooling my preschoolers at home while I work on new resources to support you in your classroom!

When I am not teaching, you will find me spending time with my family, relaxing at the beach, playing in my kitchen, or digging into a sensory bin with my little ones!
