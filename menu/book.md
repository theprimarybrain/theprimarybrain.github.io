Hello friends! Thanks for stopping by my website! I am so excited to share the news that I wrote a book with all of you! My book is called [_My Phonics Workbook_](https://amzn.to/2DTwFlP) and it is a F-U-N way to learn to read through 101 games and activities. This book covers the phonics building blocks that are critical to reading success. Through puzzles, games, literacy activities, and more, this workbook is play-packed with “aha” moments that help pave the way to becoming a stellar reader.

[_My Phonics Workbook_](https://amzn.to/2DTwFlP) includes the following elements:
* Letters A-Z - By beginning with letters, children learn the building blocks of individual consonant and vowel sounds.
* Sounds to Words - Cumulative lessons in this book allow new readers to progress from letter sounds to blends and digraphs.
* 101 awesome activities that include coloring, tracing, mazes, puzzles, word searches and more to keep kids motivated and excited to learn to read from the beginning to the end of the book.

Lots of exciting news will be announced during the pre-order period as we gear up for [_My Phonics Workbook_](https://amzn.to/2DTwFlP) to be released on June 18, 2019. I can't wait to share sneak peaks of my book, free resources to use with the book, and other fun details right here on my blog!
