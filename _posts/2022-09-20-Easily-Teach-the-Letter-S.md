Little Miss Muffet is a favorite nursery rhyme of mine, and my toddler absolutely loves to sing along with me once I get it stuck in my head. Unlike adults, toddlers seem to have no fear and love to touch and learn all about spiders. Since most toddlers are fascinated by these 8-legged creatures, I just knew I needed to create some awesome and educational **spider activities for toddlers**.  This [Spider Themed Letter S Toddler Curriculum Unit](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Toddler-Activities-Lesson-Plans-Spider-Preschool-Curriculum-Letter-S-4158005?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Spider%20Toddler%20Post) will allow your toddler to have some creepy crawly fun! 

## Lesson Components 

This unit is made up of 5 lessons that will each work on the following activities:
- literacy/language 
- sensory bin 
- math and science activity 
- fine motor activity 
- gross motor activity 
- art activity 

## Fine Motor Activities

Dot paints may be the _best invention ever_. I wish I had thought of it! Help your child not only learn about spiders but teach them the shape name _circle_ at the same time!

Clothes pins are a great tool to help your toddler with **fine motor skills**. Let your child add some legs to the spider in this fun fine motor activity!

## Sensory Bins 

[![Toddler]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/spider-toddler-sensory-bin.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Toddler-Activities-Lesson-Plans-Spider-Preschool-Curriculum-Letter-S-4158005?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Spider%20Toddler%20Post)

Create a spooky spider web out of yarn, string, or even cooked spaghetti! Add some plastic spiders, and your child can sort the letters by uppercase/lowercase.

You can’t have activities with a spider theme and not build some fun spiders. Make sure to grab some pipe cleaners, googly eyes, and Playdoh. Your toddler will surely have some fun in this build-a-spider sensory bin. 

## Math Activity 

[![Toddler]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/spider-toddler-math-activity.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Toddler-Activities-Lesson-Plans-Spider-Preschool-Curriculum-Letter-S-4158005?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Spider%20Toddler%20Post)

Math activities do not need just to just be pencil and paper. Grab some spider erasers, or print out some paper spiders and have your toddler add the correct number of spiders to the web.

## Literacy Activity

[![Toddler]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/spider-toddler-book.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Toddler-Activities-Lesson-Plans-Spider-Preschool-Curriculum-Letter-S-4158005?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Spider%20Toddler%20Post)

Kids love the itsy bitsy spider, and creating a book is a great way to help with their reading skills. Have fun learning the classic nursery rhyme, and help your little learner with reading, too! 

Sometimes your toddler is just not ready to open up a book and read! That’s ok and absolutely normal! Give them a little [more reading practice](https://theprimarybrain.com/literacy%20activities/2019/09/05/Alphabet-Letter-Activities/) with [alphabet flashcards](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Alphabet-Letter-Flash-Cards-4360287?utm_source=My%20Blog&utm_campaign=Letter%20Name%20and%20Sound%20Identification), [roll and read activities](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Roll-and-Read-Letter-Names-Sounds-Literacy-Activity-3091774?utm_source=My%20Blog&utm_campaign=Letter%20Name%20and%20Sound%20Identification), or some [alphabet worksheets](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Alphabet-Worksheets-Letter-Names-and-Sounds-Practice-Pages-4220898?utm_source=My%20Blog&utm_campaign=Letter%20Name%20and%20Sound%20Intervention).
