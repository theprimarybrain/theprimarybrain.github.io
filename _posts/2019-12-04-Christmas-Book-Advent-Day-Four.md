Today is day 4 of our Christmas Book Advent! This morning my son woke up and immediately asked for his advent book! I was so excited that reading a book was the first thing on his mind this morning. It certainly helps that this meant he could open a present! 

Today we read [Merry Christmas Mr. Mouse](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0803740107/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0803740107&linkCode=as2&tag=theprimarybra-20&linkId=ae27dd4b47f5a3acab380e78aac1050e). This was such a sweet story about a mouse family who make a home under a kitchen stove in a big house. This is where their family first experiences the magic of Christmas through an evergreen tree decorated with lights, ginger and peppermint smells in the air, and cookies baking in the oven. I loved that this story opened my child's eyes to all the magical Christmas moments that he is either already experiencing, or will experience in the days to come.

After reading the story, we made some Salt Dough Christmas Ornaments that we will use to decorate our Christmas tree later this week. Sweet smells of Christmas filled our home since we included a little cinnamon in our ornaments. The smells and moments we shared together as a family reminded me so much of the mouse family as they prepared their home for Christmas! [Click here for my Salt Dough Recipe](https://theprimarybrain.com/christmas/2019/12/04/Salt-Dough-Christmas-Ornaments/) that I explain in detail in another blog post. 

Since today was so much fun at home, I am so excited to read this story to my first grade class next week and make some ornaments to decorate our class Christmas tree! I hope you enjoy making new memories through this story and fun activity!
