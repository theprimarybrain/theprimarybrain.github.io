It's my favorite time of year again! The one where the wind begins to blow and the leaves begin to change colors. To celebrate, I love breaking out all the Fall things at home and in my classroom to get into the Fall spirit! Read below to see some of my favorite Fall activities to do at home with my toddlers and at school with my first graders. 

## Fall Leaves Art Activity

This activity is an oldie but goodie. I remember going on nature walks with my mom when I was a child. We would collect leaves in all shapes and sizes. Then, we would turn these leaves into a fun art activity! We would roll crayons over the leaves to see the leaf prints come through on the paper. I hope you enjoy this activity and creating memories with your little ones!

### How to Make Fall Leaf Art
Before beginning this art project, you will need the following items:
* Fresh leaves
* Unwrapped crayons
* Construction paper
* An excited kid!
When you are ready to begin, lay out all the leaves you collected under a large piece of construction paper. Then, roll the unwrapped crayons on their sides all over the paper. Watch the magic happen as all the veins and margins of the leaves appear on the paper. I love to include a few different types of leaves since it makes for some great discussions after completing the artwork. 

## Fall Themed Alphabet Puzzles

If your littles need to work on uppercase and lowercase letters, then I have a fun freebie just for you! These fall themed alphabet puzzles are so easy to prep and go. I just cut out the pieces, laminate, and place in individual task card boxes. They are great for all ages from busy toddlers to first grade students who need to review their letters.

## Fall Lapbook Craftivity
![FallLapbook]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/Fall-lapbook-Collage.jpg)
This is one of my favorite ways to incorporate writing into a fun fall activity! I am always looking for ways to incorporate fine motor skills into lessons so the coloring and cutting skills are a huge plus in my book. Just a word of warning... The cutting will take a bit of time, so if your students are struggling with this skill,  you may want to work on one piece of the lapbook each day. 

In addition to fine motor skill development, your students will work on narrative writing, engage in reflective thinking, question what they want to learn, and build vocabulary, all while completing a fun craftivity! Just add construction paper or a file folder and you have everything you need to create a lapbook all about the fall season.

## Autumn Math Worksheets

These are great for fast finishers during math lessons. I always have a few of these on hand to give to any students who finish an independent work activity before other students are ready to move on.

## Pumpkin Number Match Game

If your littles need to work on identifying numbers, then this pumpkin number match game is the perfect math center and whole group game for your students! When playing this game, I like to give each student or partner pair a workmat. Then, I mix up all the game cards. As I show each number card, my students will claim the card that goes on their workmat. All students are encouraged to say the number that is represented on the card.

I hope these activities gave you a few new ideas for adding some Fall fun to your week. Enjoy the fall season with your littles!
