Working with my students in small groups is one of my favorite parts of the day. It is the time where I can target the individual literacy skills that my littles need to become fluent readers and meet their reading goals. In order to meet with all six of my groups, I MUST have a plan and be organized. In the past, I have used different folders for each group, but I found that I could never fit all my materials in the same place.

This year, I found this six drawer organizer and it has made all my workshop organization dreams come true! The drawers are deep enough that workbooks, decodable books, and worksheets are all in the same drawer ready to go for each group. I labeled all of the drawers by group name using the [Black and Bright Bin Labels](http://bit.ly/2C4g3EQ) from my TpT Store. The organizer comes with wheels you can attach to turn into a rolling cart, but I removed to keep on my horseshoe table.

I hope this organizer helps make your life a little easier too!
