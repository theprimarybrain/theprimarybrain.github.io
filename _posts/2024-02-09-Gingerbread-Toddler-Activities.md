Nothing makes it feel more like the Christmas season than digging into some fun gingerbread activities for toddlers! I love to break out all of our gingerbread themed lesson plans the week after Thanksgiving so we can stretch out all the holiday fun for as long as we can. If you want to fill this holiday season with hands-on fun for your little ones, then here are a few of our favorite activities!

## Gingerbread House Sensory Bin for Toddlers

[![Gingerbread Toddler Curriculum]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/gingerbread-toddler-sensory-bin-houses.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Gingerbread-Toddler-Lesson-Plans-Christmas-Preschool-Activities-Curriculum-8320868?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Gingerbread%20Toddler%20Unit)

My favorite way to introduce this gingerbread theme is through this Gingerbread Sensory Bin! Your little ones will love getting to dig their hands through their favorite sensory bin filler to find all the pieces to build their own gingerbread house. You can begin by selecting a building and laying on the table outside the bin. Then, your little one can add all their favorite accents to their house. 

## Gingerbread Math Activitites for 2 to 3 Year Olds

[![Gingerbread Toddler Math]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/gingerbread-toddler-math.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Gingerbread-Toddler-Lesson-Plans-Christmas-Preschool-Activities-Curriculum-8320868?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Gingerbread%20Toddler%20Unit)

Finding ways to hold our children's attention during learning activities is so important! This fine motor math activity does just that! In this lesson, you just need some pom pom balls and gingerbread counting cards. Your child will count and match pom pom balls to the circles on each gingerbread man while counting. You can even add in some plastic tweezers for an extra challenge if your child has mastered their pincer grasp.

## Puzzles to Teach Uppercase Letters to Toddlers

[![Gingerbread Letter Puzzles]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/gingerbread-toddler-puzzles.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Gingerbread-Toddler-Lesson-Plans-Christmas-Preschool-Activities-Curriculum-8320868?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Gingerbread%20Toddler%20Unit)

Toddlers need a lot of repetition when learning the names of letters. These gingerbread puzzles are a great tool for practicing the names of letters since they use their little hands to match each letter. As they match the letters, you can say the name of the letter and your child can repeat the letter. 

## Gingerbread Fine Motor Activities for Toddlers

[![Gingerbread Lacing]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/gingerbread-toddler-lacing.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Gingerbread-Toddler-Lesson-Plans-Christmas-Preschool-Activities-Curriculum-8320868?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Gingerbread%20Toddler%20Unit)

Finding ways to build fine motor skills from a young age is crucial to building strength and control in the tiny hand muscles in little hands. These lacing cards will help your child's fine motor skill development as they prepare to start writing in Kindergarten! If it your first time lacing, you may need to model how to put the lace through the hole with hand over hand movements with your child.

_If you aren't familiar with what fine motor skills are, then you can read more about this here:_ [What are Fine Motor Skills?](https://theprimarybrain.com/fine%20motor%20skills/2024/01/25/What-Are-Fine-Motor-Skills/)]

[![Gingerbread Dot Markers]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/gingerbread-toddler-dot-marker.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Gingerbread-Toddler-Lesson-Plans-Christmas-Preschool-Activities-Curriculum-8320868?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Gingerbread%20Toddler%20Unit)

Any time I break out the box of dot markers, my kids come running! There is just something magical that happens when a child presses a dot marker onto a paper! I love to use dot marker printables to work on fine motor hand control since our little ones think they are creating their latest mastermiece, but we know that they are also building hand control in their little hands.

## Gingerbread Coloring Book for Toddlers

[![Gingerbread Book]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/gingerbread-toddler-book.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Gingerbread-Toddler-Lesson-Plans-Christmas-Preschool-Activities-Curriculum-8320868?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Gingerbread%20Toddler%20Unit)

No gingerbread week is complete without some gingerbread cookies! In this book, your child will listen to you read all the steps to make some cookies. Then, they can color the pictures in the book. 

I also love to pair this book with our favorite play dough recipe in this blog post: [No Cook Christmas Playdough Recipe](https://theprimarybrain.com/christmas/2018/12/11/Homemade-No-Bake-Christmas-Playdough/). Your kids can use this dough to "make cookies" for hours while they tough, see, and smell the dough!
