This year I decided to go with a Superhero theme in my classroom. This is the first time since my first year teaching that I have done a full theme in my room. As fun as it is, I had forgotten just how many hours are involved in decorating my room with a full blown theme! I am wanting to redo every little thing on my classroom walls, but there are just not enough hours in the day. Even though it added several looooonnnng hours the first month of school, it is all worth it since my students feel like superheros who can take on the world! I hope you enjoy a tour of my classroom!

  _Mistakes are proof we are trying_ is a quote I help my students to live by in our classroom. Making mistakes is **OK** and is a part of learning! I grabbed this quote banner from [The Enthusiastic Classroom.](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Mistakes-Quote-Banner-Freebie-2579476)

My absolute favorite part of my classroom is my whole group meeting area in front of my math wall. I designed a [**superhero calendar set**](http://bit.ly/2fAeMPZ) and it is so much fun to go through each morning! I grabbed a small white board from Costco that has been great for classroom meetings, math circles, and phonics instruction.

My small group meeting spot is right under my [**Word Wall**](http://bit.ly/2xLuZbw). I love meeting here so that all the resources my students need to help them during small group reading and writing groups is right at their fingertips. I was given this 8 cube shelf that another teacher found at Ikea and the baskets were only $5 at Walmart!

I always put up a writing wall to showcase monthly student writing. This year, my students created themselves as superheros to fly with their awesome writing.
