Today is the final day of my BLOG LAUNCH!! My heart is overwhelmed with joy by all of the support I have received. If you are just stopping by, be sure to check out all seven blog launch posts for some really fun freebies.

When I think of the game of Memory, so many fun childhood memories come flooding in. I grew up playing this game with my Mormor (Grandma) late into the evening with a cup of hot apple cider. It was one of my favorite games to play with her. Naturally, I thought this would be so fun to play with my students! I am adding this to my Halloween game tubs for Fun Fridays and Halloween day.

## How to Play Memory Game
The game begins by laying all cards face down. The first player will turn over two cards to see if they match. If they do, the player picks up the cards and places in front of them. If they do not match, the player will turn the cards face down again in the same location. The game repeats until all matches have been found.

*TEACHER TIP:* Be sure to print the memory cards on cardstock or mount to construction paper. I learned **the hard way** when I printed on copy paper and all the cards were see-through!

### Ways to Use Memory Cards in the Classroom
The best teaching resources can be used for multiple purposes. These cards do just that! I like to use for teaching new vocabulary by showing the words and photo cards in a pocket chart. You can also pass out one card to each student as a writing prompt. They make great partner picking cards too! Just pass out all cards and your students will find their partner by matching their card to someone else.
