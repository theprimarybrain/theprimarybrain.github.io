March is here and that means it is time to break out our St. Patrick's Day toddler activities! This month, we are filling our days with pots of gold sensory bins, St. Patty's play dough activities, and shamrock crafts! If you would like join in the fun, you can grab all of our St. Patrick's Day printable materials in this [St. Patrick's Day Toddler School Unit](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/-50-off-48hr-St-Patrick-s-Day-Toddler-School-Lesson-Plans-and-Activities-9040486?utm_source=PB%20Blog%20&utm_campaign=St.%20Patrick's%20Day%20Toddler%20School).

Picking clovers from a field is definitely a core memory from my childhood. I LOVED trying to find 4 leaf clovers, because everyone knows this would bring good luck! So, to work on our cutting and pasting skills this month, we are cutting and tearing green papers to paste onto our shamrock!

## Sensory Bins

[![StPatricksToddler]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/st-patricks-toddler-sensory-bin.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/-50-off-48hr-St-Patrick-s-Day-Toddler-School-Lesson-Plans-and-Activities-9040486?utm_source=PB%20Blog%20&utm_campaign=St.%20Patrick's%20Day%20Toddler%20School)

Have you ever used a sensory bin with your little ones? I love how engaged my children are as they run their fingers through a sensory bin filler as they work on an educational activity in a fun and playful way! To get started, just fill a bin with your favorite sensory bin filler. I love using pom pom balls as a sensory bin filler since they are squishy to run fingers through, all while being easy to clean up should they spill. As an added learning bonus, my daughter helped me pick out all the colors of the rainbow to add to this bin. 

To create this bin for your child, just add two dishes into your favorite sensory bin filler. Then, have your child sort each uppercase and lowercase letter into the two dishes. As they pick up each letter, say the name of the letter to practice letter names. You can download these pot of gold letter cards from our [St. Patrick's Day Toddler School Unit](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/-50-off-48hr-St-Patrick-s-Day-Toddler-School-Lesson-Plans-and-Activities-9040486?utm_source=PB%20Blog%20&utm_campaign=St.%20Patrick's%20Day%20Toddler%20School) to work on uppercase and lowercase letters.

In this second sensory bin, we added in some plastic tweezers and a printable rainbow workmat to work on fine motor skills. Learning to use tweezers can be tricky at first, but they are an excellent tool to use to help your child gain hand strength as they squeeze the tweezers to pick up each pom pom ball and place on their rainbow mat. 

To add in some fun conversation, ask your child what they think is at the end of the rainbow! We loved reading a St. Patrick's Day book and learning about how a pot of gold can be found at the end of the rainbow, then building our own rainbow!

## Fine Motor Skill Activities

Playdough is always a hit in our house! In this activity, I created St. Patrick's Day vocabulary cards so we could work on the names of various symbols that our little ones may encounter in their daily lives this month. Then, we rolled snakes and balls of dough and used them to build the symbols. 

Playing with playdough from a young age is an excellent way to build up the tiny hand muscles in little hands. Kindergarten will be here before you know it, and this activity will help your child's fine motor skill development as they prepare to start writing!

Dot markers are another fun tool to use to work on hand strength and hand control. In this dot marker activity, your little ones will have the opportunity to grasp a dot marker, while having to use precise hand control to dot inside each circle. It's also a great opportunity to teach the difference between inside and outside vocabulary. 

## Work on Patterns

[![StPatricksToddler]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/st-patricks-toddler-pattern-strips.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/-50-off-48hr-St-Patrick-s-Day-Toddler-School-Lesson-Plans-and-Activities-9040486?utm_source=PB%20Blog%20&utm_campaign=St.%20Patrick's%20Day%20Toddler%20School)

In this activity, we worked on building patterns using our St. Patrick's Day themed pattern strips. Depending on your child's ability to use scissors, you can cut pre-cut the cards, or you can give your child the cards to cut out themselves. Then, have your child place each card on a pattern strip to complete the pattern.
