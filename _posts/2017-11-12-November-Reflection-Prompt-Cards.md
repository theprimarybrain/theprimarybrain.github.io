November is such an important time of reflection in my classroom as we think about all the things we are thankful for. In the past, I have always done crafts centering around thankfulness, but this year I wanted to take this a step further. I want my students to think critically about what they are thankful for and to share these ideas with their peers. I included a thankfulness prompt in my [November Reflection Prompt Cards](http://bit.ly/2AA4JiC) because I wanted to hear my students share what their little hearts are most thankful for. We all know the typical answers...my family, my friends, my home...but now that my students are comfortable sharing their hearts with our class, they are now including very personal family details.

One of the things I am thankful for this year is that I have the opportunity to help my students reflect on important moments in their lives. During November, we discuss what their dreams are, the superpower they would like to have, how they celebrate Thanksgiving, their skills, and how to deal with problems at school. We are also discussing important character building concepts such as what it means to be a good student and how to be a leader. 

I have found that my reflection circles are such a meaningful time to learn more about my students and the lives they live outside of school. It is so important that we teach our students how to reflect in order to help our students think critically about how to improve all areas of their lives. It is when we reflect that we can correct mistakes we have made, improve upon our ideas, and create new meaning for things we have already learned. 

If you want to try out my reflection prompt cards, you can grab my [November Reflection Prompt Cards](http://bit.ly/2AA4JiC). You can also grab my [Reflection Prompt Card Bundle](http://bit.ly/2iPL8na) if you want to keep reflecting for the whole year. I hope you enjoy some wonderful conversations with your students this month!
