A few of my students are still struggling with writing words containing long vowel sounds. My favorite intervention for working on long vowel spelling patterns is this fun [Long Vowel Write and Wipe Activity Mat](http://bit.ly/2IARwtJ). This activity covers so many areas of student need through vocabulary, spelling, and writing. This activity can last as little as a few minutes or as long as you need since students can work through multiple word cards. Once students master the spelling of each long vowel spelling pattern, we focus on writing extended and combined sentences using more than one word card per mat. 

### How to Implement These Activity Mats in Your Classroom

To complete this activity, all you need is a sheet protector, write and wipe mat, word cards, and an expo marker in your favorite color. To complete the workmat, each student will grab a long vowel word card and place in the blank square on their workmat. I like to discuss the vocabulary behind the word before students write the word. Students will then write the word in the top box and then use it in a complete sentence at the bottom of the mat. To help my struggling writers, I offer sentence frames on the board for them to use.

It is so easy to pull these workmats out when I have extra time after a guided reading lesson or for those littles who just need some extra practice. I love using these workmats during small group workshop so that I can correct student work and make suggestions on ways to improve. These workmats also give me a quick glance at how students are progressing in their ability to write long vowel spelling patterns and complete sentences. These activity mats are also a student favorite during literacy centers! You can grab my [Long Vowel Write and Wipe Activity Mats](http://bit.ly/2IARwtJ) in my TpT store!
