Hearing a child ask Jesus into their hearts to accept the Lord into his or her life is one of the greatest joys I will ever experience. It is such a personal moment that will change the life of a child! Inside the [Beginner's Bible](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/031075013X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=031075013X&linkCode=as2&tag=theprimarybra-20&linkId=dd6edeaa97a0baf2f410731dd7f7f3ee), there is a wonderful story about how Jesus died on the cross and rose from the grave. This Bible story opens the door to discuss how Christ paid the price for our sins so that we can go to Heaven when we die. If we ask Jesus into our hearts, then we become a Child of God and He will be with us wherever we go. There is no greater joy than hearing a child make this decision to become a follower of Christ.
