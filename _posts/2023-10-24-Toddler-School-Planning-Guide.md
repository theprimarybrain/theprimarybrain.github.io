Are you looking to plan activities for your toddler? Well you are in the right place! I know how challenging it can be to plan activities that will hold your child's attention, while also having fun! 

I created this guide to give you lots of activity ideas that you can quickly implement with your little ones. In this guide, we talk about how to choose a theme based on your child's interests. Then, you will create a daily routine for your home or classroom based on the theme. 

As part of this daily routine, we take a deep dive into 6 skill areas that you can focus on with your toddler:
- sensory bins
- fine motor skills
- literacy and vocabulary
- math activities
- gross motor skills
- arts and crafts

Just sign up here to get right to work planning toddler activities:

  window.fd('form', {
    formId: '65388aed2aaccd4af3f7fe5a',
    containerEl: '#fd-form-65388aed2aaccd4af3f7fe5a'
  });
</script>

Each section of the guide reviews what each of the 6 skill areas are and why they are important for your toddler. Then, I share a variety of toddler activities for each skill area that you can do with materials you most likely have on hand already!
