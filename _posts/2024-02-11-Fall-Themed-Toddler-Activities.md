Nothing gets me more excited than thinking about the fall season... The air turning crisp, the leaves turning gorgeous shades of orange and red, and raking large piles of leaves for my toddlers to jump in. It's the perfect season to cozy up with our little ones while we read books, eat too much pumpkin, and create fall themed toddler activities for our little ones. So, let's dive right in to our fall lesson plans for toddlers!

## Fall Toddler Lesson Plans

## Fall Sensory Bins for Toddlers

[![FallSensoryBin]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/toddler-fall-sensory-bin-alphabet.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Fall-Themed-Toddler-Activities-Autumn-Preschool-Curriculum-and-Lesson-Plans-6277164?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Fall%20Toddler%20Unit)

I love to begin every new theme with a sensory bin that introduces the theme we are learning through for the week. To set up your bin, fill a large bin with your favorite sensory bin filler. I used black beans, pinto beans, and red and yellow rice. Give your child time to dig their fingers in to experience the colors of fall! Then, you can add in some fall letter cards for your child to use to learn the name of each letter.

[![FallSensoryBin2]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/toddler-fall-sensory-bin.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Fall-Themed-Toddler-Activities-Autumn-Preschool-Curriculum-and-Lesson-Plans-6277164?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Fall%20Toddler%20Unit)

I love using sensory bins to practice a wide variety of skills. In this bin, your child will build puzzles by matching two pieces to complete the picture. You can also take the opportunity to practice the name and color of each shape on the completed puzzles.

## Fall Math Activities for Toddlers

[![FallMathCounting]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/toddler-fall-math-counting.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Fall-Themed-Toddler-Activities-Autumn-Preschool-Curriculum-and-Lesson-Plans-6277164?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Fall%20Toddler%20Unit)

Do you have any of these little candy pumpkins on hand? They are an excellent tool for working on counting! In this activity, your child can match an item to the picture of a pumpkin on the counting card. You can use this opportunity to work on number names and counting objects. 

[![FallMathCounting]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/toddler-fall-math-stack-count.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Fall-Themed-Toddler-Activities-Autumn-Preschool-Curriculum-and-Lesson-Plans-6277164?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Fall%20Toddler%20Unit)

Another great way to work on counting is by stacking blocks on top of a number. In this example, we use unifix cubes, but you could also use Legos, wooden blocks, or any other block you have on hand. Then, watch your child learn to build towers by stacking their blocks to show each number. 

[![FallMathClipCards]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/toddler-fall-math-clip-cards.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Fall-Themed-Toddler-Activities-Autumn-Preschool-Curriculum-and-Lesson-Plans-6277164?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Fall%20Toddler%20Unit)

Our little ones need as much fine motor practice as we can give them to help build strong muscles in their little hands. I love to use clip cards to work on counting to give our little ones the opportunity to squeeze and clamp the [clothespin](https://amzn.to/48aElv5) onto the card. This will provide counting practice while also building fine motor skills.

## Fall Crafts for Toddlers

[![FallMathClipCards]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/toddler-fall-art.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Fall-Themed-Toddler-Activities-Autumn-Preschool-Curriculum-and-Lesson-Plans-6277164?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Fall%20Toddler%20Unit)

[Dot markers](https://amzn.to/3ODpxy4) make everything more fun! To complete this activity, all you have to do is give your child a leaf cut out of paper. Then, watch as your child dots fall colors onto their leaves to create a work of art! If you need a leaf printable, you can grab it in my [Fall Toddler Unit](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Fall-Themed-Toddler-Activities-Autumn-Preschool-Curriculum-and-Lesson-Plans-6277164?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Fall%20Toddler%20Unit).

## Fall Fine Motor Activities for Toddlers

[![FallFineMotor]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/toddler-fall-fine-motor-acorn-art.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Fall-Themed-Toddler-Activities-Autumn-Preschool-Curriculum-and-Lesson-Plans-6277164?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Fall%20Toddler%20Unit)

Here is another art activity that puts our [dot markers](https://amzn.to/3ODpxy4) to great use! In this printable activity, your little ones will feel like they are completing a craft, but they are also building hand control. Your little one will work on hand-eye coordination as they use controled motions to stamp the ink dot right inside each circle. 

This is also a great way to practice the vocabulary words inside and outside as your little one dots their dot marker on the page. 

[![FallFineMotor]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/toddler-fall-lacing-cards.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Fall-Themed-Toddler-Activities-Autumn-Preschool-Curriculum-and-Lesson-Plans-6277164?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Fall%20Toddler%20Unit)

Here is another fine motor activity that will also work on hand control! To make it easier to lace the card, I find using shoelaces with the stiff tips are much easier than yarn. If this is your child's first time lacing, you may need to model how to put the lace through the hole with hand over hand movements.
