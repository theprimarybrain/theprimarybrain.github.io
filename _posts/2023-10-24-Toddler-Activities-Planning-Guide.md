Are you looking to plan activities for your toddler? Well you are in the right place! I know how challenging it can be to plan activities that will hold your child's attention, while also having fun! 

I created a free quick start guide to give you lots of activity ideas that you can quickly implement with your little ones. You'll learn about how to choose a learning theme based on your child's interests. Then, you will create a daily routine for your home or classroom based on the theme. 

<div id="fd-form-65388aed2aaccd4af3f7fe5a"></div>
<script>
  window.fd('form', {
    formId: '65388aed2aaccd4af3f7fe5a',
    containerEl: '#fd-form-65388aed2aaccd4af3f7fe5a'
  });
</script>

## Create a Daily Schedule for Toddlers at Home or in a Classroom

Let's start planning! The first step in planning activities for toddlers is to create a daily schedule. In our toddler learning time, I typically plan the same types of activities each day so that my little ones know what to expect.

Inside the guide you will find a toddler lesson plan template that you can use to plan daily activities for toddlers! We cover 6 skill areas to plan for and why they are important for your toddler. Then, I share a variety of toddler activities for each skill area that you can do with materials you most likely have on hand already! 

## What should I teach my toddlers?

This guide is created to give you 6 skill areas to focus on as you create activities for your little ones:

- Sensory Bins: A hands-on way to play while learning new skills.
- Fine Motor Skills: Build strong hands to prepare toddlers for writing.
- Literacy and Vocabulary: Help your toddlers learn language and letters.
- Math Activities: Work on numbers, counting, and more!
- Gross Motor Skills: Get little bodies moving!
- Arts and Crafts: Fun activities that let little hands create!

Just use each activity page in the guide for ideas for each toddler learning skill area and you will be on your way to a fun week of learning with your little ones! If you want to grab all of the ideas, just sign up for the guide here and I will send it right over:
