Are you looking to plan activities for your toddler? Well you are in the right place! I know how challenging it can be to plan activities that will hold your child's attention, while also having fun! 

I created a free quick start guide to give you lots of activity ideas that you can quickly implement with your little ones. You'll learn about how to choose a learning theme based on your child's interests. Then, you will create a daily routine for your home or classroom based on the theme. 

<div id="fd-form-65388aed2aaccd4af3f7fe5a"></div>
<script>
  window.fd('form', {
    formId: '65388aed2aaccd4af3f7fe5a',
    containerEl: '#fd-form-65388aed2aaccd4af3f7fe5a'
  });
</script>

Let's start planning! The first step in planning activities for toddlers is to create a daily schedule. In our toddler learning time, I typically plan the same types of activities each day so that my little ones know what to expect.

Inside the guide you will find a toddler lesson plan template that you can use to plan daily activities for toddlers! We cover 6 skill areas to plan for and why they are important for your toddler. Then, I share a variety of toddler activities for each skill area that you can do with materials you most likely have on hand already!
