Valentine's Day is right around the corner and I am SO EXCITED about this fun writing craftivity we will be creating! This year I decided to work on narrative writing during Valentine's week. I love using lapbooks in my classroom because they allow us to work on writing all week by adding small pieces to this lapbook project each day. My students will be reflecting on a special person in their life to create this [Valentine's lapbook keepsake gift](http://bit.ly/2rANJZU) for. I will be encouraging my students to create for a parent or grandparent who shows them love on a daily basis. By the end of the week, students will have a really special gift to give to a special person in their life.

Inside the lapbook, students will be writing about their special valentine using the verbs *is, has,* and *likes*. They will also be writing reasons why they love their valentine and why their valentine is special. I love to read about their Valentine's Day memories since they help me get to know my students a little better.

The final piece of the lapbook is to write a special letter to their valentine. I like to save this piece for the end so that my students have reflected on their memories and feelings toward their valentine through other writing pieces. I hope your students enjoy reflecting on a special person in their lives!
