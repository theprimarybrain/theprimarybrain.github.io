Today is the 3rd day of my blog launch giveaway and so I thought I would help you spruce up those Halloween bulletin boards that still need *a little something*. I created Halloween name tags to place below student artwork in my hallways. My students work so hard on their work and I wanted a special name card to show it off. These tags can also be used for labeling Halloween center tubs, supply bins, and student desk tags. Head on over to TpT to grab my [Halloween Student Name Tags freebie](http://bit.ly/2gjXIOC)! I also have free [owl name tags](http://bit.ly/2hJ52zH) and [community helpers name tags](http://bit.ly/2gdOZJR) in my store if you need something for all year. Be sure to check out all seven days of my blog launch giveaway!
