Summer is right around the corner, so it is time to break out all the ice cream themed activities! Since we are spending more time at home right now, I wanted to put together a free activity that you could use with your little ones this summer! We are working on matching uppercase and lowercase letters here at home, so this activity is perfect for our homeschool preschool. I can't wait to use this activity with my students when we return to school after the summer. 

## Setting Up Your Sensory Bin
Children love running their fingers through sensory items such as rice, beans, and pom pom balls! To set up this sensory bin, I filled a dish with pom pom balls. They are soft, squishy, and reminded us of ice cream scoops. Then, add in the paper scoops of ice cream from letters A to Z. You can print on cardstock or laminate to help the scoops hold up after several uses. 

## Playing and Learning

Cut out the cones and place in a stack. Give your child the sensory bin and cones. Have your child draw a cone and place next to the bin. Then, grab the matching ice cream scoop and place on top of the cone that matches the letter. Keep playing for as long as your child is engaged. 

I hope you enjoy using this activity with your child or with students in your classroom. You can grab the activity by filling out this form:
