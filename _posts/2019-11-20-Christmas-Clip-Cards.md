It's time for a Christmas freebie! I am always looking for fun ways to build vocabulary in my classroom and these clip cards are the perfect literacy center activity for the Christmas season. 

### HOW TO USE IN YOUR CLASSROOM

Not only do these clip cards work on vocabulary, but they also work on spelling. Once your students have identified the name of the image on the card, they will place a clothespin on the correct spelling of the word. I love how easy it is for me to check student work by giving the completed clip cards a quick glance to check the spelling. Then, my students remove the clips and the activity is ready for the next student to use.

### EASY PREP

The best part is, all you have to do is print, cut, laminate, and throw these cards into a task card box with a few clothespins! I included a cover in this freebie that you can tape onto the front of an [Iris Photo Box](https://amzn.to/2O4XJny) to save space and stay organized. My friend Rachael over at [Literacy with the Littles](https://literacywiththelittles.com/) showed me this amazing teacher organization hack a couple years ago and it has saved my sanity when it comes to all the different clip cards we use in class!

I hope that these Christmas Clip Cards make your teacher life a little bit easier this winter season. [CLICK HERE to download my Christmas Vocabulary Clip Cards!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C9rEvBsnfdPRT2kJD2UL-xwb7YqPqPEE/view?usp=sharing)
