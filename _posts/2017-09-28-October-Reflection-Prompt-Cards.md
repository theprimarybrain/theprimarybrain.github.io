Reflection in the classroom is an important part of learning. When we take the time to allow our students to reflect during the school day, it gives them a chance to soak in all that they learned that day. This year, I am closing each school day with a closing circle where we discuss and reflect on a specific topic.

As we head into October, we will be discussing topics such as what to do when we have a problem on the playground, how we feel when we are sick, a problem in our school that we would like to fix, family celebrations in October, and what we learned this month. I created a set of [October Reflection Prompt Cards](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/October-Reflection-Prompt-Cards-3172477) so that all I have to do is grab a card and I am ready to start our closing circle. I keep all of my cards on a ring so all I have to do is grab a card and go! I am learning so much about my students through these quick discussions and the year has only begun! You can also grab my entire year [Reflection Prompt Card Bundle](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Reflection-Prompt-Cards-for-the-Entire-Year-GROWING-BUNDLE-3172934) in my TpT store.
