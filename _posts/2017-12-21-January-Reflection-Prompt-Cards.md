Snowflakes, winter, New Year Resolutions, goals, weight loss, cold weather, and ice skating are all words we associate with the month of January. As we head into the new year, my classroom will be reflecting on our goals and getting into a strong growth mindset. We will be discussing any resolutions that our students want to achieve with their families and how they want to see changes in themselves as we begin this year. Since we finish up our weather unit in early January, we will also be reflecting on winter weather, how things change in the winter, and fun activities our students can participate in. Our class will also be reflecting on how to show kindness, patience, and honesty in our lives.
