Today is day four of my blog launch giveaway. I am already thinking about _all the fun_ we will have on Halloween in my classroom. I have already grabbed glowsticks and treats, but I still need to work on my costume! I love finding ways to incorporate learning standards into seasonal games and activities. My students really enjoy playing *I Have Who Has* games, so I created a Halloween version to reinforce the vocabulary words we have been learning this month.

The game begins when the first student reads "I have the first card. Who has bat?" The student who has the word "bat" on their card stands up and reads the entire card. The game continues until a student reads the last card. While going through the cards, I like to have my students place their cards under our document camera so all students read the sight and vocabulary words and pictures.
