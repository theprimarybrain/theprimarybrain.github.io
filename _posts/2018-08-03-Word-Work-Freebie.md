I can't believe the summer has already come to an end and we are all headed back to school over these next couple of weeks! I found these SUPER FUN alphabet erasers in the Target Dollar Spot and these [Bananagram Letter Tiles](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932188126/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1932188126&linkCode=as2&tag=theprimarybra-20&linkId=6d6f6aec052a4cfb37f299e1c3c86ea1) on Amazon. We work so hard on mastering CVC words at the beginning of the school year, so I knew just the thing to use them for. During our first literacy center rotation, I will be having two stations set up - one with mini alphabet erasers and the other with the letter tiles. Students will use this Work Work building mat to build cvc words. When students complete the workmat, they will use an iPad at the station to photograph their work. This way, students can complete the center activity more than one time, but still be able to show me their work when the rotation is complete.
