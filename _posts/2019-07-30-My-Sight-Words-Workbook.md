Hello friends!! I have been secretly working on another special project over the past 6 months and I am so excited to share the news! You were all so supportive of my first book, so I can't wait to share that I wrote a second book! It is called [_My Sight Words Workbook_](amzn.to/2NY7sOg) and it is now available for pre-order on Amazon! [_My Sight Words Workbook_](amzn.to/2NY7sOg) includes the following elements:
* **A colorful and illustrated sight word book** ― Pictures, examples, and a little monkey helper make this book friendly and encouraging.
* **Ready to read** ― This book is ready to use exactly as it is, and the pages can be easily reproduced for a whole classroom.
* **Progress Tracking Section** ―Kids can color in a star for every word they master and see their progress in real time.

Lots of exciting news will be coming over the next six weeks as we gear up for [_My Sight Words Workbook_](amzn.to/2NY7sOg) to be released on September 10, 2019. I can't wait to share sneak peaks of my book, free resources to use with the book, and other fun details right here on my blog!
