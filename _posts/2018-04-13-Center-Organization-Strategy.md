Keeping centers organized is definitely a challenge in my classroom. There are so many moving parts to each center, so it is crucial to keep them organized in a way my students can easily access. We have a weekly rotation schedule that allows my students to independently pick up their center and bring back to their tables. I found these <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004QJGW6C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004QJGW6C&linkCode=as2&tag=theprimarybra-20&linkId=d9e1ee47aa9cc031f940e1bbc53b3d09">Large Sterilite Clip Boxes</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=theprimarybra-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B004QJGW6C" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> on Amazon and they are everything I have ever needed to organize centers. The lids stay on and the handles are easy to use. They have lasted all year and are not showing any signs of wear! I plan to invest in more of these bins to keep all of my centers in. You can grab these <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004QJGW6C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004QJGW6C&linkCode=as2&tag=theprimarybra-20&linkId=d9e1ee47aa9cc031f940e1bbc53b3d09">Large Sterilite Clip Boxes</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=theprimarybra-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B004QJGW6C" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> on Amazon using my affiliate link!

Last summer, I picked up a bunch of adhesive labels from the Target dollar spot. These were just what I needed to help me label my new center bins!
