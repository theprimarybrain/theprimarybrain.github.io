When I think of Kindergarten students, a few select words come to mind - curious, shapeable, and little. These sweet little ones are sponges who want to soak up all the learning that they can! This is why I think it is so important to teach young children how to memorize Bible verses. By teaching kindergarteners to hide Bible verses in their little hearts, we are giving them the tools they need to go through challenging moments in life. They may be young, but they are capable of memorizing short verses and phrases by practicing each day. 

## How to Get Started
If you are still reading this, then I hope you want to teach Bible verses to your child or your kindergarten class this year. I am so excited to share my [Kindergarten Bible Verse Memorization Curriculum](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Bible-Verse-Memorization-Pack-for-Kindergarten-3052682?utm_source=TPB%20Blog&utm_campaign=How%20To%20Teach%20Bible%20Verses%20-%20Kinder) with you and a few tips that I picked up along the way. This pack includes 20 weeks of Bible verses to help young learners begin to memorize scripture. The curriculum begins with very simple verses made up of two or more words. During the course of the 20 lessons, the verses will slowly increase in difficultly in order to build confidence, while also challenging your children. 

## What to Expect

Many children thrive on routine, so this pack was created to follow a similar format each week. Each of the 20 weekly lessons include 3 practice pages with an assessment to be given on the fourth day.

### Day 1: Read and Illustrate the Verse
On the first day, read the verse of the week. You can help your child find the verse in the Bible, or you can read the verse off the wall poster or notecard included in the pack. Then, give your child a fun writing utensil to use to illustrate the verse. We LOVE our [Crayola Supertips Markers](https://amzn.to/2GEYCic) for this!

### Day 2: Read and Trace the Verse
On the second day, read and trace the verse. Kindergarteners always need handwriting practice, so this is a great way to throw in some extra practice!

### Day 3: Read and Write the Verse
On the third day, read and write the verse. 

### Assessment
To assess children on the Bible verse, you will ask your child to recite the verse aloud. If your child is ready to write you can offer the challenge of writing the Bible verse. 

If you notice that your child is struggling to master the verse during the week, then I suggest you spend two weeks on the verse. You can easily add additional activities such as making up a song, cutting up the poster to make a puzzle, or you can simply repeat the same activities from the prior week. 

## Tracking Progress Through a Bible Verse Journal

As your child memorizes a first each week, they will add a cut and paste strip of the verse into their Bible Verse Journal. I love this journal because my children can use it to practice previously learned verses. This is excellent for tracking progress! We love looking back and seeing all the verses we have learned over the year. 

I hope you are as excited as I am to dive in and begin teaching your children how to memorize Bible verses.
