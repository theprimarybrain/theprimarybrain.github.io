Fine motor skills are very important for early development, and this million-eyed monster is toddler approved and a fun Halloween activity. Let your kiddo make little liquid glue dots, and place some googly eyes on top of the dots. **Pro tip: place worksheet on a tray to keep messy glue contained.**

Sensory play is all about running little fingers through a variety of materials, while teaching our toddlers to contain their messy materials in a bin. This sensory bag is a great way to enjoy different textures, in a mess-free way! It will not only make your child say “ew” but make for a fun Halloween activity.  You can also add plastic spider webs and pumpkins or create a sensory bottle instead.
