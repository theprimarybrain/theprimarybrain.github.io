Are you looking for activities to do with your toddlers? I know how challenging it can be to plan activities for toddlers and I want to come alongside you to make this as easy as possible for you! I remember when I started planning toddler activities 6 years ago. I spent so many hours just pouring over resources to try to plan our toddler lessons, so I want to help you save time by sharing what has worked so well for us!

I want to take the guesswork out of creating toddler lesson plans so I put together our Toddler Curriculum Map to do just that! It maps out all 40 of our favorite toddler themes that include a theme for each letter from A to Z, holidays, and seasons. Just sign up here and I will email it right over to you:

<div id="fd-form-65f1da75f97cdc8ec73dee06"></div>
<script>
  window.fd('form', {
    formId: '65f1da75f97cdc8ec73dee06',
    containerEl: '#fd-form-65f1da75f97cdc8ec73dee06'
  });
</script>

## What is a Curriculum Map, anyways?!?!

A curriculum map is used to show what skills and topics are taught in a curriculum. You know your child needs to learn a lot of new skills during their toddler years, but what are the skills and when should we teach them? My goal with this curriculum map is to help give you a roadmap of when to teach each skill to your toddler over the course of the next year. 

## How to Use Your Toddler Curriculum Map

![6 Toddler Skills]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/toddler-curriculum-map-6-skills.jpg)

Now that you have your curriculum map, let's go over how you can use it! I created this curriculum map to give you the tools you need to teach your little ones! At the top of each page, you will see the following headers:
- Weekly Theme
- Literacy Skills
- Math Skills
- Fine Motor
- Sensory Play
- Arts and Crafts
- Gross Motor

![6 Toddler Skills]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/toddler-curriculum-map-skill-areas-on-plans.jpg)

Under each header, you will see the skills we learn each week. It is so fun to watch our toddlers learn new skills through play based activities. I hope you enjoy watching your littles learn new skills as they play!

## Our School Year Homeschool Preschool Calendar

I have included our favorite 40 themes in the order I choose to teach them to my own children. There is no right or wrong order, but I hope this gives you a starting point. You can view the **school year calendar** in the download to see how each theme falls over the course of a school year. Some years there may be some adjusting needed depending on when holidays fall, but this will give you a great starting point!

## How to Plan a Toddler Lesson

Once you have determined the theme you wish to begin with, it is time to start planning! I have created a blog post to go with each theme in the curriculum map. Just click the links in the far right column on your curriculum map and you can grab lots of free activity ideas to go with each theme. 

Here are some helpful blog posts that explain more about the skill areas covered in the curriculum map:
