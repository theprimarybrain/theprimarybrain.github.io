It's that time of year where the whole school is testing and winding down to close out the school year. I thought our admin could use a little pick me up, so our class created a Jar of Sunshine for each of our administrators. This is also a great gift for Teacher Appreciation Week!

We filled the inside of each jar with sweet notes that can be read anytime they need to add a little sunshine to their day. We wrote about ways our administrators show kindness, how they help our school, how they help each student, and fun reasons why we like them. It was definitely a fun project that my students took pride in!
