Are you looking for a simple and fun way to work on letters with your students? Then I have the perfect freebie for you! We love using our [Letter of the Day Boost Binder](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Letter-of-the-Day-Activity-Reading-Boost-Binder-FREEBIE-7067735?st=dc311d8442f7acf6e8428562b3bbc884) in my classroom because it is filled with letter names and sounds activities that are all reusable! 

## How to Use Your Boost Binder

Each student will need their own binder. All you have to do is add 2-4 sheet protectors to a binder or folder and fill with the letter of the day practice pages. Then, you will cut out the letter cards and place in a zip-top bag. We place this bag in the front pocket of our binder so my students always know where it is! Then, you will also need a dry erase marker and something to erase with, and your binders are ready to go!

## Letter of the Day Activities

The best part about this binder is that it is jam-packed with practice opportunities. We usually open each morning by working on this spread in our Boost Binders. It only takes a few minutes, and we are able to work on letter naming, handwriting, and drawing a picture!
- First, we go on a letter hunt for the letter we are focusing on. We circle the uppercase letter and the lowercase letter.
- Then, we write the uppercase letter and the lowercase letter.
- Last, we draw a picture that begins with the letter sound.

During centers, I like to work on this binder spread with a small group. I will usually place a few letter cards on the table and ask my students to find a specific letter. They will look for the uppercase and lowercase letter and place it in the boxes. Then, they get to practice writing the letter in the box as many times as they can!
