Small group reading and writing intervention is my absolute favorite part of the school day. So, for the 2nd day of my blog launch, I created a free Halloween version of my Write and Wipe Activities. I love this resource because I can address multiple content areas in one lesson including reading, ELD, writing, speaking, and vocabulary.

The best part about this lesson is that it is truly **NO PREP**. I can pull out the materials anytime without ever having to worry about making copies or prepping materials. The lesson begins when each student chooses a Halloween picture card. We discuss the vocabulary word on the picture card and then students write the word on their mat. Then, each student writes a sentence using the word from the card they selected. If my student makes a mistake, I show the correction using a fancy colored dry erase marker. We repeat this process until our rotation is complete. I differentiate this resource by providing picture cards without text. Grab this [**Halloween Write and Wipe Activity Mat**](http://bit.ly/2xGLFCd) in my TpT store!

Since I have so many reading levels in my classroom, I created a [**Short Vowel Write and Wipe Activity Mat**](http://bit.ly/2yp5pJN) as well as a [**Long Vowel Write and Wipe Activity Mat**](http://bit.ly/2xGcRfP) that you can grab in my TpT store.
