Do you remember where you were on September 11, 2001? I will never forget the exact moment that my Dad called me into his room to give me the news. I remember that I was blow drying my hair and getting ready for middle school, just like any other day. However, 09-11-01 was not just any other day. As I stood and watched the news with my Dad, the gravity of what had happened began to sink in. It was the day that many lives were lost due to terrorism. 

I still went to school on that tragic day. We were all upset, but it was because of amazing teachers that we were able to sort through our feelings about what had happened. As teachers, we hold an incredibly important job. We have the future of the world in our classrooms and it is our job to educate and inspire our students to be the best they can be, despite the tragic events that may happen in their lives. Our teachers were loving, supportive, and kind. They were just what we needed on that day. My hope is that our generation of teachers are just as effective, kind, and compassionate in our classrooms as my teachers were on that day. 

Our country will never forget that day.
