It's day 2 of our Christmas Book Advent and today we read [The Nativity](https://amzn.to/2OyrcGQ)! This is one of my favorite books to read at Christmastime because it teaches my children the reason we celebrate Christmas - The birth of baby Jesus! 

### A Special Party to Kick Off the Season!

This past weekend we kicked off our Christmas Book Advent by throwing a Happy Birthday Jesus party! We set up all the fun [tableware](https://www.orientaltrading.com/happy-birthday-jesus-party-pack-a2-4_1870.fltr) that I received from Oriental Teading Company and enjoyed some really fun family activities! It was a wonderful time bringing the Nativity to life through all the activities.

### Party Favors

As if that wasn't enough, we ended the party with fun [party favors](https://www.orientaltrading.com/happy-birthday-jesus-novelty-assortment-a2-4_1929.fltr) from the Oriental Trading Happy Birthday Jesus party pack! It was definitely a party that my children will remember for years to come!
