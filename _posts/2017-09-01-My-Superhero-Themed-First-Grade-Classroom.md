This year I decided to go with a Superhero theme in my classroom. This is the first time since my first year teaching that I have done a full theme in my room. As fun as it is, I had forgotten just how many hours are involved in decorating my room with a full blown theme! I am wanting to redo every little thing on my classroom walls, but there are just not enough hours in the day. Even though it added several looooonnnng hours the first month of school, it is all worth it since my students feel like superheros who can take on the world! I hope you enjoy a tour of my classroom!
