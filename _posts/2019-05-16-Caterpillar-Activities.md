Springtime is one of my favorite times of the year with my little ones. There are so many fun outdoor science themed activities we can do! This week was all about caterpillars. My son is 3 1/2 and loved learning this week!

We started our week by coloring a picture in [_My Phonics Workbook_](https://amzn.to/2DTwFlP) about caterpillars. We talked about the letter C and the sound it makes. Since my son is 3, I used hand over hand writing movements to teach him how to trace the letter C.

Then, we colored the caterpillar using colorful colors. This workbook is geared for 4 to 6 year old children, but the first few activities are easy enough for 3 year olds. It was the perfect way to introduce caterpillars and all the fun we were going to have this week!

After coloring our caterpillar, we headed off to our neighborhood garden center to purchase some milkweed. Milkweed is the dinner of choice for caterpillars, so what better way to try to lure some into our yard than by planting some milkweed!

I walked my son through the steps of planting the milkweed. First, we dug a hole in the ground. Next, we added some water. Then, we added fresh soil. Finally, we planted the milkweed and filled the dirt in around our new plant. It was so much fun!

When we finished planting, we used our [Kwikstix Paints](https://amzn.to/2w0FVQr) to make some "binoculars" to use while we hunted for our caterpillar friends. We didn't find any caterpillars...YET... but we found some snails and had fun trying!

It was such a fun day!
