It's hard to believe we are already headed into April! That means there are just two short months before I have to say goodbye to the sweet littles in my classroom. I am so excited about the reflective conversations we will be having in April as we wind down the school year. Since April Fool's Day kicks off this month, we are having a discussion about what a prank is. It is really important to me that my students know and understand that pranks are meant to be funny and are not meant to hurt anyone. We will also be discussing ways to show kindness when playing pranks. I am hoping that my students will carry this mindset into the weekend as they go home to their families. 

I love discussing what my students need from their teacher, so I wanted to spend an entire class meeting on this topic. So often we get so focused on what we need our students to do and how they need to perform in the classroom. But... too often I forget to stop and think about the really important things that they need from me. I am hoping this discussion prompt will provide a deep and meaningful conversation about the things they need from me on an emotional and personal level. 

As we continue through the month of April, we will also be discussing topics such as spring activities, what it means to be a good sport, courage, bullying, trustworthiness, and what it means to give back. I hope you enjoy meaningful conversations with your class this month. [Click here to grab my April Reflection Prompt Cards](http://bit.ly/2pRwU8Q).
