Nothing feels more like childhood than a fresh batch of homemade playdough! My go-to recipe for playdough is this lemon scented dough. If you haven't ever tried cooking in the kitchen with your little ones, then today is the day!

Measuring, pouring, mixing, and kneading are all excellent exercises for building fine motor skills in their hands, plus it is so much fun to help!

Playdough is an excellent tool for developing fine motor skills, so we used it to make a pretend pie! All you need is a pie tin and some playdough tools such as a rolling pin and plastic knife. Then, just give your child the dough and watch the magic of imaginative play!
