 Sometimes I have nightmares at night about all the time a student wastes when he or she does not have a pencil. You know the one... The student who sits at his desk and does not get ANY work done because he doesn't have a pencil. To win the pencil war in my classroom, I allow students to take a sharpened pencil anytime they need one as long as they return a dull pencil. So far this year, I have not had any students take advantage of the out of seat time, but I will keep my _fingers crossed_!
