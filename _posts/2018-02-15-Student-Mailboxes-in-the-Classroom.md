I feel like I am always passing out endless amounts of papers from the office. From parent meetings, to holiday reminders, to fundraisers, they just never seem to end! Last year I implemented a student mailbox system. This literally saved my sanity! Any time I receive notes that go home, I give to my mailbox monitor and that student files each paper in the folders to go home. Each student in my classroom has a classroom number, so I labeled each folder with their same numbers. Students check their mailboxes at the end of the day as we pack up for dismissal. I do inform my students if they do not need to check their mailboxes so we minimize the time it takes to pack up.
