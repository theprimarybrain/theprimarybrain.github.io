Do you have a teacher in your life that you would love to buy something special for? I have put together a list of my top 12 favorite self-care gifts for teachers. These items are great for relaxation, rejuvenation, preventing illness, and stress relief. Any of these items will make a perfect gift for teacher appreciation week, a Christmas gift, or any time you want to show a special teacher in your life that you appreciate all they do! 

### My Top 12 Favorite Teacher Self-Care Gifts

1. [**Zojirushi Coffee Mug**](https://amzn.to/2T4Nzrh) - To help a teacher drink hot coffee all day long! I have never had coffee stay hot all day long in a mug before!

2. [**Vahlrona Chocolate**](https://amzn.to/2El34kA) - To help a teacher enjoy a sweet treat. On stressful days, nothing is better than a bite of chocolate!

3. [**Dry Shampoo**](https://amzn.to/2IKn9Gl) - To help a teacher sleep a little longer. I love not having to wash and style my hair as often thanks to this dry shampoo!

4. [**Bath Bomb Set**](https://amzn.to/2tFgsLm) - To help melt away the stress of a long day of teaching. Long baths with a bath bomb are one of the best things I have found for my own self-care.

5. [**Barefoot Dreams Blanket**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BLUR2WG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01BLUR2WG&linkCode=as2&tag=theprimarybra-20&linkId=26d4e234e688c4fca85811080c60f2eb) - To help a teacher sit down and relax. I was given this blanket as a gift and it is the softest, most cozy blanket I have ever used!

6. [**Ahava Lotion**](https://amzn.to/2H4XJAG) - To help keep hands and feet hydrated. This lotion is magic!

7. [**Lanyard**](https://amzn.to/2NyIy41) - To help add flair to a teacher's attire. This lanyard helps me stay focused and ready for anything since I can't lose my keys! 

8. [**Flair Pens**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077NZ1R8J/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B077NZ1R8J&linkCode=as2&tag=theprimarybra-20&linkId=550af6f2ce8e07754f4b840353c8d2c5) - To help make grading papers more fun. Plus, they write so easily that my hand doesn't get sore from writing for too long!

9. [**Hand Sanitizer**](https://amzn.to/2T8uuEz) - To help keep the teacher in your life healthy. I love keeping bottles of sanitizer by each classroom door, on my desk, and by my classroom phone.

10. [**Teacher T-Shirts**](https://www.thewrightstuffchics.com) - To help a teacher be his or her best self. I am always more excited to be teaching when I am wearing a fun teacher t-shirt! 

11. **Massage, Facial, or Pedicure** - To help heal the teacher's body and mind. We all need an excuse to close our eyes and just RELAX!

12. [Teachers Pay Teachers Gift Card](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Gift-Card) - To help add time a teacher's day. Teachers Pay Teachers has saved me so many times since I can just print a lesson, make copies, and be ready to teach! No extensive lesson planning required!
