Let's take learning to the beach! There is no better way to fill our summer days than with a quick trip to the beach. Since we are local to the beach, I love to find ways we can take our learning to the beach during all 4 seasons of the year.

This scavenger hunt is perfect for outdoor learning so that we can go to the beach all year long!

<div id="fd-form-66c8faa16366b71fc8ff1598"></div>
<script>
  window.fd('form', {
    formId: '66c8faa16366b71fc8ff1598',
    containerEl: '#fd-form-66c8faa16366b71fc8ff1598'
  });
</script>

## Beach Scavenger Hunt Printable
A great way to build vocabulary is through a scavenger hunt! I love to take a clip board and a box of colored pencils to the beach and let my children walk around and find each item on their scavenger hunt page. As they find each item, they sit down and color the picture. Grab your scavenger hunt here:
