This [Cut and Paste Long Vowel Activity](http://bit.ly/2HWai2Z) is just what my students needed to practice their long vowel spelling patterns. First, we review the two spelling patterns on the worksheet to ensure all students can read the pattern correctly. Next, students highlight the spelling pattern within each word at the bottom of the page. Then, students cut out the words and then place under the spelling pattern they go with. 

This activity is great for my intervention groups since there are only two spelling patterns to focus on at a time. I also enjoy using this activity when I introduce new spelling patterns as a way to familiarize my students with how the pattern looks. My students also complete these activities during literacy center rotations while I work with small groups. 

I hope your students love learning long vowel words as much as mine do! You can grab this [Cut and Paste Long Vowel Activity](http://bit.ly/2HWai2Z) in my TpT store! You can also grab this resource as part of my [Cut and Paste Word Sorts Bundle](http://bit.ly/2IoPHnp).
