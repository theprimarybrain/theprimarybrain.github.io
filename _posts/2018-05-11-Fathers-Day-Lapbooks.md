Father's Day is such an important event in our student's lives. But now that our school district is getting out at the end of May, we aren't in class at this time of year. Since we do so much for Mother's Day, we as teachers need to make an effort to create a Father's Day gift for our students before we head out for the summer. I always tell my students to "keep it a secret" and save the gift for Father's Day. One of my favorite Father's Day crafts is my [Father's Day Lapbook](http://bit.ly/2rsiVHx). My students write such sweet notes to their Dads and always color the most beautiful pictures. I especially love the pictures they draw of their fathers on the front cover!

Inside the lapbook, students will create a flip book that is all about their dad! They will write specific details such as what their dad likes to do and something he is really good at.

Students will also complete this fun flap book by writing reasons why they love their dads under each flap.

I always hear how much dads love the coupons they receive from their children! This pocket is created by gluing down the sides and bottom of the paper. I *always stress* not to glue the top or the coupons won't be able to go in the pocket. 

![Back of Lapbook]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/fathers-day-lapbook-back.jpg)
On the back of the lapbook, my students will write a special letter to their dads. I always leave it up to my littles what they want to say in this special narrative writing piece. I also add in a mini lesson where we discuss a friendly letter and the proper greeting and signature in the letter. 

*Teacher Note:* Since some of my students do not have a dad in their life, I created alternate pages for a lapbook to an uncle or grandfather. By this point in the year, we should know if this is the case for our students. However, ALWAYS check to make sure! 

I hope you have a great end to the school year creating a fun keepsake for each student's father! You can grab my [Father's Day Lapbook in my TpT store](http://bit.ly/2rsiVHx)!
