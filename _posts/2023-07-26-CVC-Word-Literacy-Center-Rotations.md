Getting started with centers can be so tricky! What activities should you use? What can your students manage independently? There are so many things to consider! 

When I think about successful literacy centers, I immediately think about material management. You need enough materials to keep all of your students engaged in learning, but they also need to be easy enough to manage that your students can complete the activities on their own.

In this post, I am sharing my favorite tips and tricks for running successful centers, and I even planned out an entire week of plans and activities for you! You can grab it here:

<script>
  window.fd('form', {
    formId: '64c14ec065f7dbbf4ebf0ba8',
    containerEl: '#fd-form-64c14ec065f7dbbf4ebf0ba8'
  });

## Organizing Materials

One of the trickiest parts of starting center rotations in the classroom is managing all the materials that come with each center. I love to use [large sterilite clip boxes](https://amzn.to/3QfkZjk) because they fit all of the materials that I use at each center. Plus, they stack so they don't take up a lot of space in my classroom! You can also put a written label, number, or sticker on the front of each bin so your students know which bin to grab. 

## Materials Management

To help your centers run smoothly all year, you will need to practice, practice, practice! On the first day of centers, you will want to practice every step that you want for your students to do independently. 

In my classroom, I like to have one student from each table group be the _Materials Manager_. This student is responsible for picking up the center bin at the start of centers and returning the bin at the end of the rotation. This way, only a few students are moving around the room at a time and it helps to keep all the materials where they need to be. 

## Independent Activities

Once your students know how to gather and put away their center materials, then it is time to practice completing the activities! First, you will want to establish volume levels for your classroom. Are your students able to whisper speak with a partner during a game, or do you want them to be as quiet as they can be? Establishing these guidelines on day one will help your centers to run the way you want them to all year long! 

## Choosing Activities

When I choose activities to use during my center rotations, I like to choose things that can be repeated each week, but for different phonics skills. This way, I only have to train my students on how to use each center one time, then they can continue using similar activities in the center each week. Here are a few of my favorite types of reusable activities:
- Partner Games
- Write and Erase Cards
- Sheet Protector Write and Wipe Mats
- Task Card Boxes

I hope these tips and activities help your centers to run smoothly all year long! I want to make starting centers as easy as possible for you, so I have planned and put together an entire week of -at family activities that I hope will make this school year a little bit easier for you!
