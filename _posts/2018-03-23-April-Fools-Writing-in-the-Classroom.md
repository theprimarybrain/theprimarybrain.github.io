April Fool's Day is such a fun opportunity for writing in the classroom! I created an April Fool's Day Writing Pack to showcase student creativity in my classroom. Their jokes are always hilarious and I love using having them read to the class to practice public speaking. If you have a microphone in your classroom, then be sure to let your students use it to read their stories to their peers!

The lesson begins with a circle map to explain what a prank is. It is so important that my students understand that an April Fool's Joke is meant to be funny, but should never hurt anyone or make them feel bad in any way. Once they understand what a prank is, then we complete a narrative graphic organizer about how to play a prank on someone.

Now comes the fun part! We write down answers to the 5 W's questions so I can make sure each student understands who and what they will be writing about. Then, students will complete a narrative graphic organizer using transition words to tell their jokes. I like to meet with small groups to review their writing before they complete their final drafts.

After my students complete their writing, they are able to complete a 6 box storyboard to tell the story of their joke through pictures. I love seeing the creativity that comes out of this!
