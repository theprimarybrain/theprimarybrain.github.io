Saint Patrick's Day is such a fun time of year in my first grade classroom. My students love reading and writing about leprechaun topics, so I thought I would throw in some fun St. Patty's Day math worksheets. I love these worksheets because they target specific skills that we are learning and need to review.

Since a few of my littles are still struggling with place value, I broke out some tens and ones manipulatives to work on writing numbers. This worksheet gives the tens and ones in word form and my students write the number in standard form.

Counting by tens is such an important skill, so what could be more fun than counting pots of gold by tens! In this activity, students cut out the pots of gold, then place and paste on their worksheet.

Word problems are always one of the most difficult mathematics concepts that my students are asked to do. On this worksheet, we will be working on addition and subtraction by counting shamrocks and leprechauns. My students are always very motivated to work on math when they get to work on seasonal concepts.

I hope these math worksheets give you some fun ideas to work on with your students through the month of March. [Click here to grab your St. Patrick's Day NO PREP Math Pack](http://bit.ly/stpattysdaymath). I hope you have a fun St. Patrick's Day week with your students!
