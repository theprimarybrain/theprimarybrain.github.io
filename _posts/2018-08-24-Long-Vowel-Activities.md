Teaching long vowels is one of my favorite concepts to teach in first grade! In all honesty, it can be exhausting and challenging to teach long vowels, but there are so many fun ways to teach these concepts. It is always so rewarding to see my students master their long vowels because I know how tricky this skill can be! Long vowels are easily confused with cvc words for many of my students because the words look so similar. For many students, our whole group lessons from our district curriculum is enough to master their long vowel sounds. However, for many other students they need small group intervention to help them master the spelling patterns. Here are a few of my favorite activities for teaching long vowel spelling patterns. 

### Long Vowel Roll and Read Activity

[Long Vowel Roll and Read Word Family](http://bit.ly/2wjuTXp) activities are a great literacy center activity since I can print on fun Astrobrights paper, laminate, and use again and again! Once students understand how to complete this activity, then they can repeat daily with different spelling patterns. 

### Long Vowel Clip Cards

[Long Vowel Clip Cards](http://bit.ly/2NhqgDF) make for an easy, NO PREP center! This pack of clip cards includes all long vowels, but is broken up into the individual vowels to make it easy for you to pick and choose the skills you are working on. These clip cards require students to identify the correct spelling pattern for the word. Two incorrect spellings are included on each card with a blackline or color image to identify. These cards are also great for teaching vocabulary skills!

### Long Vowel Write and Wipe

[Write and Wipe Long Vowel Activity Mats](http://bit.ly/2w96W4M) are one of absolute favorite small group intervention activities. I always keep 10 workmats on hand to easily pull out for two small groups. Students say the word aloud, write the word in the box, and then use the word in a sentence. I always check the spelling of each word prior to writing the sentence to ensure correct spelling. If students are struggling with spelling the word associated with the word card, then I teach the specific spelling pattern in our small group. 

### Long Vowel Cut and Paste

These [Cut and Paste Long Vowel Worksheets](http://bit.ly/2BKqjpZ) are perfect for literacy centers. Students cut out all the words and then place in the correct box. Before pasting, I like to have students partner up in their centers to check for accuracy. After pasting, students read the words several times to build word fluency for each spelling pattern. 

I hope you are feeling inspired to try out some new long vowel reading activities!
