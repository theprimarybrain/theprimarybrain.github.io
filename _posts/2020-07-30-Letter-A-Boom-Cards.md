This year, my students will be starting the school year virtually so I have been thinking a lot this summer about how I will best deliver my phonics instruction. I will be having daily Zoom meetings with my class where we will work on phonetic awareness, segmentation, blending, decoding, and other phonics skill practice. In addition to live teaching, I knew I needed extra practice that my students can complete on a device. This is where BOOM Cards come in! I created a set of [Letters Boom Cards](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Letters-Alphabet-Boom-Cards-Digital-Task-Cards-Distance-Learning-5813779) that work on introducing and reviewing letters in a fun and meaningful way! You can [_click here_](https://theprimarybrain.com/digital%20learning/2020/05/27/How-To-Get-Started-With-Boom-Cards/) to read all about how to get started with Boom Cards in another post.

I created an individual deck of Boom Cards that will address each letter of the alphabet. As students begin playing this letter A deck, they are introduced to the name of the letter. They work on tapping the letter in isolation, then they move on to tapping the letter when presented with other letters at the same time.

The best part about this fun activity is that I was able to add audio to every card! Not only are students able to play an engaging game, but they are also hearing me say the name of the letter over and over as they work through the deck. This was perfect for teaching letter sounds because I can have the child hear the sound and choose pictures that coorespond to the beginning sound we are focusing on.

After we work through the letter name and sound, I decided to add some additional cards where my students can work on typing the letter on their keyboard. This is an excellent way to introduce each letter on the keyboard in isolation.

I hope you are as excited as I am about using Boom Cards to teach letters to your students! They are perfect for students learning in a one to one classroom with devices, or for students who are at home learning.
