I love how easy they make filling in bubbles when working on a hands-on worksheet. Even though my son is only two years old, we have already started working on uppercase and lowercase letters since he can identify most letters by name. Of course, adding dot markers to any activity will make it more engaging for a preschool or kindergarten lesson!

What could be more fun than taking your students on a letter hunt using [ABC Dot Color Uppercase and Lowercase Letter Worksheets](http://bit.ly/2IZJvDz)!?! To work on uppercase and lowercase letters, choose two dot marker colors and fill in the identifying bubbles at the top of the worksheet. Then, students will dot all the letters below in the cooresponding color. You can use crayons, markers, or any other art supply, but <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W3Y5/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00004W3Y5&linkCode=as2&tag=theprimarybra-20&linkId=96685c329063acebeecdd71766beb324">Dot Markers</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=theprimarybra-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B00004W3Y5" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> are definitely a student favorite! This makes for a quick and easy literacy center or small group activity to see how your students are progressing.

This activity was so much fun to try out with my son. He could not get enough of the dot markers! It was so sweet to hear him say "big A, little a" as he went through and dotted the letters.
