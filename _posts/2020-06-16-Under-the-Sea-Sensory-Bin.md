We are in full summer mode here at home so what could be more fun than a sand and sea sensory bin! In this bin, you will go on a letter hunt to find the letters under the sea! All the letter tiles are face down, so my kids had so much fun guessing the letter they would draw next and then turning over a letter tile. 

## Setting Up Your Sensory Bin

To prepare this activity, you will fill half of a bin with sand. Then, you will add the blue letter tiles inside the second half of the bin. All the letters will be face down so that your child cannot see the letters. Grab one letter tile at a time and place on the ABC workmat next to the bin. Each time a letter tile is drawn, say the name and sound for the letter. Keep drawing letter tiles until all the letters are matched.
