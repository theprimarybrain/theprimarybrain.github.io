It can be challenging to fit everything in! But, just like school-aged children, toddlers can enjoy learning about the freedoms and patriotic holidays we enjoy in our country. These patriotic activities for toddlers are the perfect mix of fun and learning and can be done in small increments of time!

Who doesn’t love to use colored pasta noodles? They are so easy to make using blue food coloring (or whatever other colors you would like) and vinegar. Toddlers could play with them forever! For this patriotic activity, have your child create a flag, firework, firecracker, top hat, or other patriotic design. Let their imagination run wild!

A little twist on a flag craft. Using red, white, and blue pom-poms, have your toddler use kid-friendly plastic tweezers and place them in each circle. Once they have finished, they will have created a sparkly American flag. 

## Sensory Bins

Sensory play is very important during the development stages of a toddler. Give your toddler plastic tweezers and pull out one letter card at a time. Have them practice saying the letter's name and placing it outside the bin. I have also included shaving cream and number card sensory bins in this [Patriotic Toddler Curriculum](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/50-off-48-Hrs-Patriotic-Toddler-Lesson-Plans-4th-of-July-Crafts-Activities-8239797?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Patriotic%20Toddler%20Post).

## Math Activity

Using the play dough mats, your child will work on identifying the number on the mat by name. Your child can roll playdough to form the numbers on the card and create shapes or balls to place on the tens frame.
