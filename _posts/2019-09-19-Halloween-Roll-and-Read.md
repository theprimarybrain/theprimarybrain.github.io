I can't even believe that Halloween is already right around the corner! I don't know about you, but I like to plan a couple weeks in advance so I can keep up with all the Holiday themed fun in my classroom. I put together this Halloween Roll and Read FREEBIE that includes the first 100 Fry words. It's a great way to work on reading, while also adding some holiday fun! Just print, laminate, and break out all those Target mini erasers that you have been hoarding and you will be ready to go. Low prep and reusable - now that is my kind of center activity! Grab your freebie here:

<div id="fd-form-65300484fe758a3c69ed6fea"></div>
<script>
  window.fd('form', {
    formId: '65300484fe758a3c69ed6fea',
    containerEl: '#fd-form-65300484fe758a3c69ed6fea'
  });
</script>
