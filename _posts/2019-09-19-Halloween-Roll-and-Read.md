I can't even believe that Halloween is already right around the corner! I don't know about you, but I like to plan a couple weeks in advance so I can keep up with all the Holiday themed fun in my classroom. I put together this Halloween Roll and Read activity that includes the first 100 Fry words. My students are working their way through the first 200 Fry words this year, so this will be the perfect Halloween center to incorporate some holiday fun! Just print, laminate, and break out all those Target mini erasers that you have been hoarding and you will be ready to go. Low prep and reusable - now that is my kind of center activity!
