Nothing gets me more excited about Christmas than decorating a tree, baking all the holiday goods, and filling our home with the smells of Christmas. This morning I tested out a new playdough recipe that smells just like Christmas. All you need is cinnamon, cloves, a little bit of love, and a few baking staples that you likely have on hand. We used whole cloves and ground using a spice grinder to amplify the Christmas smell. This recipe is perfect for preschoolers at home, or for your classroom since there is no cooking required. Just combine all the ingredients, mix, and you are ready for hours of fun!

### Ingredients:
- 2 cups flour
- 1 cup kosher salt
- 1 Tbsp. cream of tartar
- 2 Tbsp. ground cinnamon
- 1 Tbsp. ground cloves
- 3 Tbsp. vegetable oil
- 1 1/4 cup (10 0z) boiling water

### Directions
Add flour, salt, cream of tartar, cinnamon, and cloves to a large mixing bowl. Whisk to combine. Add oil and stir. Add boiling water and stir to combine. Once cool enough to touch, knead with your hands to combine the playdough. Add a few play items such as a rolling pin, plates and utensils, cookie cutters and Playdoh tools for hours of fun!
