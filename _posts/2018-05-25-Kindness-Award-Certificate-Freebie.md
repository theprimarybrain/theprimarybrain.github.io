Teaching kindness in the classroom is so important. If we can teach our students to be kind to one another, then we have been successful as teachers. Each month of the school year I like to select a few students who I have caught being kind during the month to receive a kindness certificate. These certificates are a great way to encourage students who show kindness to continue to be kind to one another.

On each certificate, my students are reminded that they were caught being kind! I like to hold a short class meeting to give other students in the class the opportunity to share examples of their friends being kind in the classroom or on the playground. I hope these award certificates motivate your students to show allstar effort in being kind every day when they come to school.
