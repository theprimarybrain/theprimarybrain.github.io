Welcome to my blog! I am **so happy** you are here! My name is Laurin and I am a first grade teacher in Southern California. I have been teaching first grade for the past five years and I absolutely love it!! Every year I have students who range in academic abilities from Kindergarten to 2nd grade. I started creating my own teaching resources because I needed to differentiate for all learners in my classroom. 

During my third year teaching, I was encouraged by a friend to open a [Teachers Pay Teachers store](http://bit.ly/ThePrimaryBrain) and share these resources with other teachers. I honestly thought she was crazy because I had just had a baby and was on maternity leave. *Despite all my excuses*, she convinced me to open my store and I am so glad that I did! Teachers Pay Teachers is such a wonderful community that I feel blessed to be a part of. 

I started this blog because I love to collaborate and share teaching ideas with other teachers. I thrive on creating fun and engaging ways for my students to learn. I would love to connect with you. Click on the social media icons at the bottom of this page to follow me. Looking forward to collaborating with you!
