Gobble, gobble! It’s time for the letter T! T, as in turkey. I absolutely love everything about Thanksgiving, like the turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, and of course, the pumpkin pie! So when I was trying to figure out some educational activities to go along with my [toddler school curriculum](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Toddler-Activities-Lesson-Plans-Tot-School-Curriculum-Homeschool-Preschool-4296281?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Toddler%20Bundle%20Upsell), I just couldn’t leave turkey activities for toddlers out since turkey and Thanksgiving both start with the letter T!

## Lesson Components 
This unit is made up of 5 lessons that will each work on the following activities:
- literacy/language 
- sensory bin 
- math and science activity

## Art Activities

Grab a couple of paper plates and some paint colors like yellow, orange, and red to create this adorable turkey! Use brown paper, liquid glue, and a fork to paint the rim of the paper plate. This is the perfect thanksgiving craft to put on your dinner table!

## Math Activities

Give your toddler these turkey number match cards and some counters. This activity not only helps with number recognition but also counting! Let your toddler count the turkeys and match the number of counters needed.

## Fine Motor Skills Activities

Grab colorful golf t’s or feathers and push them partially into a foam half-ball. You’ve now made yourself a fine motor-turkey! Give your toddler a wooden hammer and let them hammer the feathers into the ball. Remind them to be gentle!

**Fine motor skills** are very important in toddler and preschooler development, and one of the most challenging skills is the ability to cut. Grab some children's dull point scissors and have your toddler practice cutting on the lines to the center.

## Sensory Bins

Add some feathers to the bottom of a bin and place all puzzle piece cards throughout the bin. Show the letter cards for T and t. Review the difference between an uppercase T or a “big t” and a lowercase t or “little t.”Your child’s job is to match each puzzle piece while reviewing letter names!

Everyone _loves_ a good build-a-turkey! Give your child some play dough, feathers, candy corn, and googly eyes to create the cutest little thanksgiving turkey. You’ll have one happy toddler!

## Literacy Activities

Memory was one of my favorite childhood games. In this game, you will flip the cards over and play a matching game with your toddler. Two two cards over at a time to see if they match. Review the vocabulary word on each card to help your child master a few new words.
