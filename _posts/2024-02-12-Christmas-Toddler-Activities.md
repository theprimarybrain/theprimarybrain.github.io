The Christmas season is one of my favorite times of year to incorporate meaningful learning opportunities for our little ones! It is the perfect time to pull out themed Christmas sensory bins, fine motor activities, and art activities for toddlers!! There is nothing more exciting than decorating the house in Christmas toddler art projects, the sound of Christmas sensory bins, and handmade toddler gifts. I included all of this and more in my [Christmas Toddler Unit](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Christmas-Toddler-School-Lesson-Plans-Winter-Preschool-Activities-Curriculum-8705519?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Christmas%20Toddler%20Unit)! Just grab a few materials and you will be ready to create Christmas toddler activities for the entire month of December!

## Santa Sensory Bin for Toddlers

[![ChristmasSensoryBin]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/toddler-christmas-sensory-bin.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Christmas-Toddler-School-Lesson-Plans-Winter-Preschool-Activities-Curriculum-8705519?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Christmas%20Toddler%20Unit)

Let's kick off the fun by learning about clothing and body parts as we build Santa in a Sensory Bin! All you need to do is fill a bin with your favorite sensory bin filler. We used black beans to represent the coal in the fireplace. Then, cut out the pieces to build Santa and tuck these pieces into the bin. 

Then, give your little one time to choose the pieces they need to build Santa. As your child selects each item say the name of the item to help your child build vocabulary.

## Christmas Fine Motor Activities for Toddlers

[![ChristmasFineMotor]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/toddler-christmas-fine-motor-prewriting-strips.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Christmas-Toddler-School-Lesson-Plans-Winter-Preschool-Activities-Curriculum-8705519?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Christmas%20Toddler%20Unit)

I love using pre-writing strips to help my little ones begin to work on writing. Using a tripod grasp (3 finger grasp) takes a lot of practice. One way to begin building hand strength and endurance is by drawing lines and curves on each card. Then, when it is time to begin writing letters, children will already be familiar with some of the motions used to write.

[![ChristmasScissorSkills]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/toddler-christmas-fine-motor-prewriting-strips.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Christmas-Toddler-School-Lesson-Plans-Winter-Preschool-Activities-Curriculum-8705519?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Christmas%20Toddler%20Unit)

Learning to safely cut with scissors is another important skill for preschoolers, but it can be tricky at first. When beginning with scissors, children need to be taught a proper grip. Then, they can work to build strong muscles in their hands. It takes time and practice for children to use scissors confidently, so the more practice you can incorporate into your day, the better! You can begin with hand over hand movements as they learn to cut with their thumbs up. If you would like to incorporate even more scissor practice, you can grab printables for every season in my [Seasonal Fine Motor Activities Bundle](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Fine-Motor-Skills-Seasonal-Centers-Practice-4-Seasons-Bins-Winter-Activities-7240892?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Xmas%20Toddler%20to%20Seasonal%20Fine%20Motor%20Bundle).

## Christmas Pattern Practice for Toddlers

[![ChristmasPatterns]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/toddler-christmas-patterns-fine-motor.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Christmas-Toddler-School-Lesson-Plans-Winter-Preschool-Activities-Curriculum-8705519?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Christmas%20Toddler%20Unit)

Learning to make patterns is another important skill for our little ones to learn. In these pattern strips, your children will work on AA, AB, and AABB patterns by pasting the missing pattern square(s) onto each strip.

## Christmas Letter Name Practice for Toddlers

[![ChristmasLetterPuzzles]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/toddler-christmas-alphabet-puzzles.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Christmas-Toddler-School-Lesson-Plans-Winter-Preschool-Activities-Curriculum-8705519?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Christmas%20Toddler%20Unit)

These letter puzzles are designed to provide a variety of practice opportunities! Your child will enjoy matching the two picture halves as they also learn new vocabulary and letter names. 

## Christmas Math Activities for Toddlers

[![ChristmasMath]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/toddler-christmas-counting-cards.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Christmas-Toddler-School-Lesson-Plans-Winter-Preschool-Activities-Curriculum-8705519?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Christmas%20Toddler%20Unit)

In this math activity, we are packing in all the fun by working on fine motor skills as your toddler works on counting. As you work on each card, your child will add "ornaments" to each Christmas tree as they learn the name of the number and count the same number of items. 

[![ChristmasMath]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/toddler-christmas-counting-cards.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Christmas-Toddler-School-Lesson-Plans-Winter-Preschool-Activities-Curriculum-8705519?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Christmas%20Toddler%20Unit)

Puzzles are so much fun for toddlers! In this activity, your little ones will learn the name of a number and work to find the matching number of objects.
