Every time the season changes I rush out to Target to grab a few packs of mini erasers. I just can't get enough! Who is with me?!?!? This year I grabbed the cutest black cats, pumpkins, skeletons, and spiders. I love these erasers because they give me a way to incorporate some seasonal Halloween fun into literacy activities.

We are in full swing with literacy centers in our classroom. This year, I have reading levels that range from early kindergarten through fourth grade. *Bring on the differentiation!* Finding ways to differentiate is a *struggle*. I put together a Roll and Read Fluency Center that is leveled for each student in my class. For my students who need to master their letters, I use my [**Roll and Read letter names and sounds worksheets**](http://bit.ly/2hRssXw). I love that they are reusable year after year and require **ZERO PREP**. I put a new set in sheet protectors each time I switch out centers and save the previous week's worksheets.

Once students have mastered their letter names and sounds, I move them on to [**CVC Roll and Read Worksheets**](http://bit.ly/2y2ZIkm). My students are so excited to fill up their boards with their mini erasers! In this set, there are 80 variations of cvc worksheets to cover each short vowel sound individually, as well as mixed practice. This keeps my students busy reading the entire time so I can focus on small group intervention.

All of my students need practice with their site words. I include my [**Fry Word Roll and Read Worksheets**](http://bit.ly/2xlsAAx) at various levels to address each student's need. Roll and read is **always** a crowd pleaser for practicing sight words. The more practice my firsties have the better!

I often use my [**Word Family Roll and Read Worksheets**](http://bit.ly/2ysz2Ll) to target specific reading gaps during small group intervention.
