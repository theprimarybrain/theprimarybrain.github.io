Now that I have two young children, I am always trying to think of new activities to enjoy during the Christmas season. Our family already has an entire collection of Christmas books that I read to my kids each Christmas season. A friend of mine shared the idea with me of turning our collection into a Christmas Book Advent. My favorite part of this tradition is reusing the books that we read each year and rewrapping to create new excitement for each story each year. Plus, it is a great way to enjoy wonderful Christmas memories without having to spend much money each year. 

I put together all of the books we will be reading this year to give you a few book ideas to purchase in case you need a few more Christmas books to pull this off! Each day this month, I will be sharing the book of the day that I am reading with my children, as well as activities, conversations, or games that we will be using to extend the fun.

My hope with our Christmas Book Advent is that this will become a tradition that can be passed on by my children to their children. There is nothing more special than reading books to my kids that my mom read to me growing up.  I know, I know... Slow down Laurin, but one can dream right?!?! If you decide to do a Christmas book advent with your own children, I would love to hear how it goes!! Tag me on Instagram or Facebook @theprimarybrain to show me all the fun you are having!!
