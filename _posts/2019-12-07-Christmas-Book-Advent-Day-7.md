Can you believe we are already a week into December? It feels like yesterday we were sitting around the table for Thanksgiving! I am so excited to kick off day 7 of our Christmas Book Advent with [If You Take a Mouse to the Movies]((https://amzn.to/35NLiTe)). If you enjoy the [If You Give a Mouse a Cookie](https://amzn.to/34bPwT9) series, then this book is going to become a quick favorite for you! It is also the perfect book to teach if...then statements and work on cause and effect. 

## Family Activity
Since this book is all about taking mouse to the movies, it would be perfectly fitting to head to your neighborhood movie theater and catch a new movie! Since my little guy isn't a big fan of the movie theater, we decided to snuggle up by the fire and watch a family Christmas movie at home. I wanted to recreate the movie theater experience, so we grabbed our favorite [Alton Brown Popcorn Recipe](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/perfect-popcorn-recipe-1917417) and my little guy and I made some homemade popcorn! It is definitely more work than sticking a bag in the microwave, but so worth it! Since today was a cold, rainy day, we picked [Frosty the Snowman](https://amzn.to/2qPZ7le)! I hope you have a magical day reading and making memories with your family!
