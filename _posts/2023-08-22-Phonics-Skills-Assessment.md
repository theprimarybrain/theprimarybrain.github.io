Small group reading is such an important part of the school day since it gives us a chance to meet with our students in a smaller setting. This is where we can focus on the specific phonics skills that our students need to become fluent readers. It can be tricky to form these groups, so I created an assessment to help you!

![PhonicsAssessment]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/phonics-assessment-teacher-pages.jpg)

This assessment is designed to be quick and easy for you to administer to each child. There are two teacher checkoff sheets that can be printed double sided and placed in a folder or binder to make these easy to refer back to in the future.

This assessment covers the following phonics areas so you can determine the phonics spelling patterns that your students already know and determine what they are ready to learn:

- Letter Names and Sounds
- Short Vowel Word Families
- Beginning Blends
- Digraphs
- R-Controlled Vowels
- Magic E Word Families 

If you would like to grab this FREE assessment, then just sign up using this form and you can begin assessing your students right away:

<script>
  window.fd('form', {
    formId: '64e4e0c39f3274e73d0b3aa8',
    containerEl: '#fd-form-64e4e0c39f3274e73d0b3aa8'
  });
</script>
