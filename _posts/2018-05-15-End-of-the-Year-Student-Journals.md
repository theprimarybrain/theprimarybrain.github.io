One of my favorite projects to do with my students is to create student portfolios to store all of their special work from first grade. If you are anything like me, then you probably have a giant stack of student work that you have saved throughout the school year... Then you get close to Open House and the question becomes *what do I do with all these fantastic projects?* 

This year I had each student create their own student portfolio to store all of their beautiful work from the school year. To create the portfolios, I had each student mount their work to a piece of construction paper. Then, I stapled all of the pieces of construction paper together to make a book. To add the perfect finishing touch, my littles colored a cover page to showcase their first grade memories.

I love to have my students write an opinion piece about their favorite day in first grade to add to their student journals. It is such a fun piece of writing for parents to read as they first open their child's yearly portfolio. 

### What I Included in my Student's Portfolios
- First Day of School Writing
- Student selected journal writing samples
- Formal Opinion, Narrative, and Informative writing pieces
- Artwork
- Community Helpers Report
- Student profile artwork
- So much more!
