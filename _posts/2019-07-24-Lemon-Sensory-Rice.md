If you love homemade sensory bins, then I have a treat for you! I made no cook lemon sensory rice for my son to use with our lemon themed sensory bins. Not only did the sensory bin provide hours of fun, but making the rice was a blast for my 3 year old. Keeping my busy toddler engaged with hands-on activities can be challenging, but this sensory rice provides endless opportunities for fun and learning. Plus, it is a no cook recipe so it only took me a few minutes of hands-on time to make!

### Ingredients:
- 2 pounds white rice
- 1.5 tbsp. lemon extract
- 15 drops of yellow food coloring

### Directions
Add white rice to a zip-top bag. In a seperate dish, combine lemon extract and food coloring. Then, add the liquids to the zip-top bag. Shake and squeeze the bag until combined. This way my son's favorite part to help with! You will know you are finished shaking when the rice is yellow in color. Once combined, lay all the rice on a sheet pan and leave uncovered on the counter for 12 hours to dry. It's the perfect after dinner activity to keep your little ones busy until bed time!

You might be thinking "I made the sensory rice, now what do I do with it?" The sky is the limit! The first day, I added the rice to a bin with measuring spoons, measuring cups, a plastic cup, and some spoons. My 3 year old played for over an hour! We also used the rice as filler for all of our [Lemon Themed Toddler School Activities](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Toddler-Lesson-Plans-Lemon-Themed-Lessons-50-off-Halfway-Sale-4616157?utm_source=My%20Blog&utm_campaign=Lemon%20Sensory%20Rice%20Toddler%20School%20Link). 

You could also add magnetic letters, numbers, puzzle pieces, or any other learning tool you have on hand. I hope you have fun playing and learning with your little ones!
