This post today is much different than what I usually blog about, but today was an incredibly special day in our home and I want to share with all of you! Today is the day that my son prayed and asked Jesus to come into his life. He will be 3 years old next week. He has been asking a lot of questions about some of his great grandparents who have passed away and other questions about Heaven. 

I took the opportunity today to read about how Christ died on the cross and rose again for our sins in our [Beginner's Bible](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/031075013X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=031075013X&linkCode=as2&tag=theprimarybra-20&linkId=dd6edeaa97a0baf2f410731dd7f7f3ee). As I read the story, my son had so many questions about the characters and the emotions they were exhibiting. After reading about how Jesus rose from the grave, we talked about how Christ paid the price for our sins so that we can go to Heaven when we die. I explained that if we ask Jesus into our hearts, then we become a Child of God and He will be with us wherever we go. He was so excited to pray and ask Jesus to come into his heart! 

After we prayed together, I made a special certificate that my son was able to sign. I want him to have something special to hang on his wall to remind him about the special decision he made today. If your child has accepted Christ into their lives, then [click here to download this free I am a Child of God certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WNaM66M3IwOSOeb_L7-co6OHEeoAJh9r/view?usp=sharing) so you can use it with your child! I would love to hear your stories about this moment in your child's life, so please reach out on social media.
