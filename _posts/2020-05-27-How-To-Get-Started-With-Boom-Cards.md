Boom Cards™ are my new favorite tool for distance learning. They are colorful, fun, and engaging! My students are able to learn the same skills that we were learning on paper through a fun digital platform. Plus, it is SO EASY for me to use. Within minutes I had my class set up, students added, and passwords created. Then, all I had to do was assign the cards I wanted my students to use and we were ready to go! 

## What Are Boom Cards?
You might be wondering exactly what Boom Cards are. *What can I use them for? How will they fit into my classroom?* 

The best part is, I have been able to create Boom Cards for any standard that I am teaching in my class. Boom Cards are simply digital task cards that can be played on a tablet, android or iphone, or a computer. It honestly feels like you are playing a game! 

## Why I Love Boom Cards
There are so many reasons that I love Boom Cards, but to keep this short, I made a list of my top favorite things:
- Engaging
- Easy to Use
- Interactive
- NO PREP
- Paperless, Digital Resource
- Reports Available for Teachers
- Self-Checking = No Grading for You!

## Want to Try Out Boom Cards?
Getting started on Boom Learning is so easy! You have two main options. You can either assign "Fast Pins" through a free account, or you can pay a very small fee (around $15) for an annual membership that gives you access to detailed student reporting. Either way, you will set up an account on Boom Learning where you will assign the decks of Boom Cards to your students. 

### Fast Pins
With a free teacher account, you can assign the Boom Cards you are buying with "Fast Pins." This type of play provides instant feedback for self-grading Boom Cards. Fast Play is a free way for students to engage with Boom Cards decks. 

### Paid Teacher Account
For additional assignment options you'll need to open a premium account. If you are new to Boom Learning, you should be offered a free trial of Boom's premium account by going to http://bit.ly/BoomTrial. By opening a premium account, you will receive detailed reporting on all the Boom Cards that your students play. My teacher heart LOVES this! You will be able to see how many cards in each deck that a student has mastered.

You can also look at detailed reporting of each time a student plays a deck. The data shows you the amount of time they were playing the deck and the specific stats of the game play. Here is an example of a round of play from my [Learning Colors Boom Cards](https://wow.boomlearning.com/deck/learning-colors-gSe5egFpkLoqpxFsX).

My students especially love seeing their lifetime scores and achievements on their dashboards.

## I Created an Account, Now What?
Once you have created an account, it is time for you to start assigning Boom Card Decks to your students. There are tons of free and paid decks available on Boom, or you can grab Boom Cards from Teachers Pay Teachers.
