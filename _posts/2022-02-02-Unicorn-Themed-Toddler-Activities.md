My daughter is all about unicorns! Unicorns bring a sense of magic into the room and are a childhood favorite! When you pair learning with your child's favorite things, it is always so much easier to inspire learning. 

This week, we are working on the letter U through a variety of unicorn toddler activities. This [Unicorn Themed Toddler Unit](https://https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Toddler-Activities-Lesson-Plans-Unicorn-Preschool-Curriculum-Letter-U-5152015) is packed with everything you need for a full week of learning. I hope your little ones are as engaged as mine was! 

## Lesson Components 

This unit is made up of 5 lessons that will each work on the following activities:
- literacy/language 
- sensory bin 
- math and science activity 
- fine motor activity 
- gross motor activity 
- art activity 

## Literacy Activities

To start this magical week off, tell your little ones that you will be playing with and learning all about unicorns. As you begin a new unit, it's fun to create a journal to store your masterpieces in. Your child can color the unicorn cover page and attach it to the front of the notebook. Make sure to say the letters in your child’s name as you write them. If your child is ready, he or she can even practice writing their own name. Don’t forget to introduce the letter U as well. If the letter U is in your child's name, then see if they can spot it.  

## Fine Motor Activities

Fine motor skills are not only fun and engaging for kids, but they’re also incredibly important! They help children perform important tasks such as feeding themselves, grasping objects, and writing. 

All you need for this activity is the letter worksheet and a dot marker. To start off, you will introduce the shape, circle. Then your child will dot inside each circle in the letter Uu. This is a great opportunity to use language like “Dot inside the circle.” I also love to have my own kids (and students) say the name of the letter (or the sound if they’re ready) each time they dot on the paper.

What could be more fun than giving a unicorn a haircut! To prepare this activity, just tape some ribbon to the back of a unicorn. Then, give your child some scissors and watch as they give their first haircut to the unicorn.

_***Don’t forget to remind your child we only cut the unicorn’s hair, not our own!_

## Sensory Bins 

![UnicornToddler]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/unicorn-toddler-sensory-bin-explore.jpg)

Sensory bins are an excellent teaching tool because kids love them and they keep our little ones entertained and busy for a while, plus you can incorporate so much learning into them. 

For this sensory exploration activity, all you’ll need to do is fill a bin with colored rice, spoons, unicorn toys, and a “water” bowl. Give your child time to explore the rice and have a fun sensory experience. The more pouring, scooping, playing and talking, the better! 

![UnicornToddler]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/unicorn-math-sensory-bin.jpg)

Like I mentioned before, I love sensory bins because you can incorporate so many different skills into them. I always find that my littles one are far more excited when we turn our learning activities into a game, such as hide and seek! Here is a fun one to try at home or in your classroom:
- Fill a bin with rainbow sprinkles. 
- Add three empty dishes to the bin. 
- "Hide” number cards under the sprinkles. 

Then, watch your little ones as they play and learn! Place one of each number card in each empty dish. Guide your child as much support as needed in sorting the numbers into the three dishes. Provide time for free play for your child to play with the bin after sorting the cards. 

![UnicornToddler]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/unicorn-toddler-sensory-bin.jpg)

We're all busy, so reusing a sensory bin filler is a great way to save time. Just switch out the skills your little one is learning to make the bin “fresh” and new. So, use the same bin filled with rainbow sprinkles, and add the unicorn sensory bin puzzle pieces. For extra fun, add a few mini unicorns into the bin. Hide the unicorns and cards under the sprinkles for a fun hunt for your child. When your child finds a match, they can lay it down next to the sensory bin.

## Math Activities 

![UnicornToddler]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/unicorn-math-book.jpg)

We love math! This number book is a quick and easy way to work on counting as you learn about unicorns. Plus, it is a great way to begin working on concepts of print. You can show your child the cover, the spine, and the pages. As we went through the book together, it was fun to count the unicorns on each page and say the number.

![UnicornToddler]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/toddler-flower-number-cards.jpg)

1:1 correspondence is the ability to match an object to the corresponding number and recognize that numbers are symbols to represent a quantity. In this activity, you will give your child number match cards and about 30 fun counters.  Place a counter on each image on the number match cards. Count aloud as you and your child place the counters on the number match cards. Simple, low prep, and engaging! 

![UnicornToddler]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/unicorn-toddler-clothespins.jpg)

Another fun way to count while also getting some fine motor practice in is through clip cards. Laminate the cards and give your child clothespins. Guide your child in clipping clothespins onto the number that matches the number of unicorns on each card. Encourage your child to count aloud. This is perfect work to strengthen those finger muscles and build up those fine motor skills. 

![UnicornToddler]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/Unicorn Pattern Strips)

Patterns are another important skill for our littles to work on. For this activity, you will cut out the unicorn pattern strips. Then, give your child 10-15 pom pom balls that match the colors on the strips. Watch as they create patterns by matching the colored pom pom balls to the colors on the unicorn pattern strips. For an extra challenge, you can even have your child try creating his or her own patterns with the pom pom balls. 

## Gross Motor Activity 

![UnicornToddler]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/unicorn-maze-gross-motor.jpg)

Gross motor skills are important for young children to practice as they learn how to coordinate and control their body movements. For today's movement activity, we set up a maze outside! It was so much fun following chalk lines to find matching unicorns. It was a great way to get moving and we loved doing it over and over again!
