Teaching language in the classroom has so many opportunities for fun learning experiences! Teaching contractions provides so many opportunities to spice up our day. I always begin the lesson on contractions by reading the book [**I'm and Won't, They're and Don't: What's a Contraction?**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0761385045/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0761385045&linkCode=as2&tag=theprimarybra-20&linkId=27111df0cefcd7df4569a46f14b197a1) By Brian P. Cleary. It is a great story chalk full of contractions. The story introduces what a contraction is and gives students multiple examples.

After reading the story, we set up our [Contraction Flap Books](http://bit.ly/2xIWSzB). Over the course of a week, I distribute a few contraction word strips to each student to glue into their books.

To further learning, I love to put out my [Contractions Puzzles](http://bit.ly/2Q0dJoT) into a literacy center for my students to work on through the week. It makes a great center since it is hands-on and my students can work together to complete the activity.
