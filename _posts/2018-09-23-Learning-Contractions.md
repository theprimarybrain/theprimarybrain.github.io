Contractions can be such a tricky skill for our students to learn, so let's make it fun! When I first begin a lesson on contractions, I love to read the book [**I'm and Won't, They're and Don't: What's a Contraction?**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0761385045/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0761385045&linkCode=as2&tag=theprimarybra-20&linkId=27111df0cefcd7df4569a46f14b197a1) By Brian P. Cleary. The story introduces what a contraction is and gives so many examples of contractions. 

I like to use this book to teach contractions over the course of 3 days. Each day we read the story one time, but we spice it up the second and third days.
- First read: Read the story from cover to cover
- Second read: Have students clap each time they hear a contraction. This really keeps students engaged!
- Third read: Have students write all the contractions they hear on a whiteboard as I read, then make a chart of all the words they wrote down.

## Contractions Activities
After you have introduced contractions, here are two fun activities you can add to your lesson plans:

### Contractions Flap Book

After reading the story the first time, I love to have my students set up our [Contraction Flap Books](http://bit.ly/2xIWSzB). Then we add a few contractions to our book over the course of the week.

### Contractions Puzzles

Our [Contractions Puzzles](http://bit.ly/2Q0dJoT) are always a student favorite during our center rotations. Just laminate the pieces and you can use them for years to come!
