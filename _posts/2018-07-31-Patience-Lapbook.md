Teaching patience from the beginning of the school year is so important! I have found that when my students are patient through the day, we accomplish so much more. To introduce the concept of patience, we complete this fun [Patience Character Education Lapbook](http://bit.ly/patiencelapbook) together! We begin by completing a KWL chart on our character wall about what we Know *and* what we Want to learn. Then, I send my students to their seats to color, cut, and paste their lapbook cover. At the end of our patience lessons, we will add what we Learned to our KWL chart.

After coloring the cover, I bring my students back to the carpet to complete an anchor chart about what patience is, and what patience is not. Then, I send students to their seats to complete a flip book extension activity. They write about how they can be a patient student by describing what patience looks like, sounds like, and feels like.

We then paste our flap book into our lapbooks and go through the questions together. My goal for this flap book is to ensure that every student understands why patience is important in their lives, in the classroom, and in other life settings.

We then discuss things we can do while we are being patient and write each example on a strip. I always give scenarios to my students of situations where patience is necessary, but I ask them what the patient behavior would look like.

### Situations to Share with your Students
- Your teacher called you to sit in a circle on the carpet, but she is not there yet. What should you do?
- You finish your math test, but other students are still testing. How can you show patience when you finish?
- You line up for lunch, but your friends are still cleaning up their desks. How could you show patience in the line?
- You finish your center early and your teacher has not told you what to do next. How can you show patience in this situation?
- You have a question for your mom, but she is on the phone. What should you do?
- Your sister or brother is using a toy that you want. How can you show patience?

To culmonate my student's learning, I have them complete this narrative writing piece about patience. It is a great way to see if my students have learned what patience is, or if I need to add a supplemental lesson. To further patience lessons in your classroom, be sure to grab my [Patience Lapbook](http://bit.ly/patiencelapbook) in my TpT store. I hope this lesson helps your students learn more about what patience looks like in their own lives!
