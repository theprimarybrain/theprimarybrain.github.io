The [100th Day of school](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/100th-Day-of-Preschool-Curriculum-and-Lesson-Plans-Toddler-PreK-Activities-12852188?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=100th%20Day%20of%20Preschool%20Activities) is one of my favorite days of school! I plan an entire day of learning around the number 100 to celebrate that we have been learning for 100 days! We all dress up like we are 100 years old - complete with clothing, wigs, glasses, pearls, canes, and anything else that a 100 year old person may wear! 

## How to Begin a 100th Day Celebration

[![100thDayMath]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/preschool-100th-day-dot-marker.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/100th-Day-of-Preschool-Curriculum-and-Lesson-Plans-Toddler-PreK-Activities-12852188?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=100th%20Day%20of%20Preschool%20Activities)

This fine motor dot marker activity is my favorite way to begin our 100th Day celebration! We discuss how we have been learning for 100 days, which makes us _100 DAYS SMARTER_! Then, just grab your favorite dot marker colors and dot each number to make the number 100.

## 100th Day Sensory Bin

[![100thDayMath]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/preschool-100th-day-sensory-bin.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/100th-Day-of-Preschool-Curriculum-and-Lesson-Plans-Toddler-PreK-Activities-12852188?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=100th%20Day%20of%20Preschool%20Activities)

In our 100th Day sensory bin, we are sorting 100 items into categories! I created the sensory bin mat with blank ten frames so that you can use any small items you have on hand inside your sensory bin. Then, give your littles time to identify which items are in the same categories and sort them on the mat! 

_Here are some items you may have on hand:_
- pom pom balls
- beans
- small stickers
- bells
- counting cubes
- legos
- small blocks
- dice
- cereal pieces
- m&ms 
- marshmallows
- buttons
- beads
- the sky is the limit here!

## 100th Day Fine Motor Skills for Preschoolers

Fine motor skills are so important for our preschoolers, so I can't let the 100th day go by without some hands-on fine motor practice!

_Read this post if you want to learn more about fine motor skills:_ [**What are fine motor skills?**](https://theprimarybrain.com/fine%20motor%20skills/2024/01/25/What-Are-Fine-Motor-Skills/)

### Lacing Cards

[![100thDayMath]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/preschool-100th-day-lacing.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/100th-Day-of-Preschool-Curriculum-and-Lesson-Plans-Toddler-PreK-Activities-12852188?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=100th%20Day%20of%20Preschool%20Activities)

Time to learn how to build the number 100! These lacing cards each include one number so that your preschoolers can learn how to place 3 numbers in order to build the number 100. 

To prepare these lacing cards, cut out each star. Then, laminate the stars and leave a small edge of lamination around each star. Hole punch each dot and they will be ready for lots of hands to practice lacing! 

### 100th Day Necklace

[![100thDayMath]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/preschool-100th-day-fine-motor.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/100th-Day-of-Preschool-Curriculum-and-Lesson-Plans-Toddler-PreK-Activities-12852188?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=100th%20Day%20of%20Preschool%20Activities)

Create a 100th Day necklace that becomes a delicious snack! First, we sort ten groups of ten pieces of cereal by color on ten frame workmat. Then, we thread each piece of cereal onto a shoelace or piece of yarn. _If you are using yarn, make sure to add a piece of tape to the end to make it easier to thread._

## Math Activities for Preschoolers

[![100thDayMath]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/preschool-100th-day-math-collage.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/100th-Day-of-Preschool-Curriculum-and-Lesson-Plans-Toddler-PreK-Activities-12852188?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=100th%20Day%20of%20Preschool%20Activities)

Our first math activity of the day is a color by number page. You can use this activity to work on the numbers from 1-9, then watch as your littles find the number 100 on the page! 

Since our littles finish activities at different times, I love to use this math puzzle and some counting clip cards for fast finishers. 

If you are completing these activities at home with your own children, then you can work through each activity at your child's pace. It's also fun to group up with a few other homeschool families for the 100th day, too!

## 100th Day Craft for Preschoolers

I love incorporating crafts into all of our learning themes! To celebrate the 100th day, preschoolers will use a q-tip to dot each gumball in the gumball machine. They can even try to count to 100 as they dot each gumball! 

[![100thDayMath]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/preschool-100-gumballs-craft.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/100th-Day-of-Preschool-Curriculum-and-Lesson-Plans-Toddler-PreK-Activities-12852188?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=100th%20Day%20of%20Preschool%20Activities)

To add an extra learning component, make sure to review color names as you pass out the materials. You can also have your littles work on creating patterns using the dots of paint.
