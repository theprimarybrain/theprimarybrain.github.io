The Target dollar spot has my heart this school year! I found this adorable pencil coin holder and knew right away that I was going to use it as a raffle ticket holder! What better pairing for a fun yellow raffle ticket holder than some fun pineapples!

### What can you use raffle tickets for?
- Completed homework
- Excellent behavior
- Random acts of kindness
- Completing classroom jobs 
- Excellent effort on classwork
- 100% on assessments
- Meeting goals
- Just because the student needs extra encouragement! 

### How can you reward student raffle winners?
Holding raffles does not need to hurt your wallet! Some of my favorite incentives for raffle winners do not have to cost you anything. 
- Lunch with the teacher - Great for Friday lunches!
- Extra iPad time
- Free choice time before the end of the day
- Teacher's helper for the day
- Homework passes
- Class game time
- Treasure chest prizes
