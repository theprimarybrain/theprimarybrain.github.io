Displaying data is a requirement at my school site. Since I have a superhero theme in my classroom this year, I created a cityscape where students fly up buildings as they meet their goals. This is _all the rage_ among my students this year because they have their own superhero that will soar as they meet their goals!

I currently have buildings to display data for Lexia, sight words, and fluency scores. I love to see the motivation in my students as they work to meet their goals. Each student has their own superhero that I pinned on the wall with a thumb tack. It is **so easy** to modify their levels since all I have to do is move a pin!  

## Make Your Own Superhero Data Wall
To create the buildings, I began by cutting out rectangular strips of black construction paper and stapling to my dark blue wall. For the windows, I printed levels on yellow Astrobrights paper and laminated to help it stay strong all year. I also typed out building "signs" to show the data we are tracking. Then, I added my student names to a superhero that is carrying a banner. Just add thumb tacks and you are ready to go! 

You can download my flying superheroes using this form:

<div id="fd-form-619919941041f04103c0e755"></div>
<script>
  window.fd('form', {
    formId: '619919941041f04103c0e755',
    containerEl: '#fd-form-619919941041f04103c0e755'
  });
</script>
