Learning sight words is HARD for some of my littles. I love finding fun and engaging ways to work on memorization. In my classroom we use the Fry Word sight word system. I created a set of [Fry Word Bookmarks for First Grade](http://bit.ly/2zGmmh7) to help break down the words into manageable sets.

Each bookmark includes 20 fry words. In my first grade class, there are 10 sets of bookmarks that my students need to master through the year. My students are *so motivated* to complete each bookmark because they love to "pass" and go on to the next set. 

### Differentiation
This year I have reading levels that range from pre-k all the way to fourth grade. My sight word bookmarks are available in a [bundle including the first 1000 Fry Words](http://bit.ly/2xXyQim). Since one of my firsties is reading fourth grade material, it has been so helpful to have these bookmarks. She wants to participate in everything we do in class, so this is a great way to include her while still teaching sight words at her level. Be sure to check out my [Fry Word Bookmarks Bundle](http://bit.ly/2xXyQim) for all 50 sets!
