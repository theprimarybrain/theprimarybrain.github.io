Valentine's Day is right around the corner and as my youngest is getting older, I am so excited to fill our days with painting, sensory bins, and all the fine motor activities our hearts desire! As we head into February, I want you to feel as prepared as I do to teach your little ones so I put together some of our favorite toddler activities for February!

## Valentine's Day Crafts for Toddlers

Little ones LOVE to create art for their parents, grandparents, and other special people in their lives. For Valentine's Day, you can make these two different art projects with your little ones that can be turned into cards for Valentine's Day:

[![Valentine Toddler Curriculum]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/valentine-toddler-school-fingerprint-art.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Valentine-Toddler-School-Lesson-Plans-Preschool-Activities-8868463?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Valentine%20Toddler%20School)

All you need for this fingerprint tree is this [printable from our Valentine Unit](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Valentine-Toddler-School-Lesson-Plans-Preschool-Activities-8868463?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Valentine%20Toddler%20School) and some liquid paint on a plate. Then, kids will tip their fingertips in the paint and press around the tree to make leaves. When finished, you can cut out the tree and paste onto a large piece of construction paper for a jumbo size card! 

I love these [Crayola Washable Paints](https://amzn.to/3UaEhrX) for this project. The set is inexpensive, but it does come with a limited number of colors. We use this opportunity to mix red and blue together to make purple for the card!

In this second craft, we combined fine motor skills and art to make another fun keepsake! First, we tore colored paper into small "pieces" and then glued onto our printable from our [Valentine Toddler School Unit](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Valentine-Toddler-School-Lesson-Plans-Preschool-Activities-8868463?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Valentine%20Toddler%20School). As my daughter pasted on each piece of paper, we talked about all the people she loves and cares about in her life. It was a great way to tie in a conversation about the reasons why each person is special!

## Letter Name and Sound Sensory Activities for Toddlers

[![Valentine Toddler Curriculum]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/valentine-toddler-school-sensory-bin-reading.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Valentine-Toddler-School-Lesson-Plans-Preschool-Activities-8868463?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Valentine%20Toddler%20School)

What could be more fun than learning letter names and sounds through a candy heart sensory bin?!?! In this bin, we used crinkled paper as our sensory bin filler and added candy heart letter cards. As children pick up each card, they can practice saying the name and/or sound for each letter, then place it in their candy heart box. We added in some extra practice by saying the name of each letter as we placed back in the sensory bin for next time. 

I made a quick video to show you how to set up this bin:

## Valentine's Day Math Sensory Bin for Toddlers

[![Valentine Toddler Curriculum]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/valentine-toddler-school-sensory-bin-math.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Valentine-Toddler-School-Lesson-Plans-Preschool-Activities-8868463?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Valentine%20Toddler%20School)

In this second bin, we built cupcakes by matching numbers! First, I cut out the pieces of each cupcake. You can find the printable pieces in our [Valentine Toddler School Unit](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Valentine-Toddler-School-Lesson-Plans-Preschool-Activities-8868463?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Valentine%20Toddler%20School). Then, my kids picked up one piece at a time from the bin. Depending on the ability level of your child, you could start with the pieces for just a couple cupcakes, or add in all six at once.

## Valentine's Day Fine Motor Activities

[![Valentine Toddler Curriculum]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/valentine-toddler-school-sensory-bin-playdough.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Valentine-Toddler-School-Lesson-Plans-Preschool-Activities-8868463?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Valentine%20Toddler%20School)

Playdough is always a hit in our house! In this activity, I created vocabulary cards so we could work on the names of various Valentine's Day symbols that may encounter in our daily lives this month. Then, we rolled snakes and balls of dough and used them to build the symbols. 

Playing with playdough from a young age is an excellent way to build up the tiny hand muscles in little hands. This will help your child's fine motor skill development as they prepare to start writing in Kindergarten!
