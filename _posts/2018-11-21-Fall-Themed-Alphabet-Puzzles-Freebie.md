Fall is one of my favorite times of year! This year, I created alphabet puzzles in a few different fun fall themes to put into my literacy rotations. This activity works on identification of uppercase and lowercase letters. I love how easy this activity is to prep and go. I just cut out all the pieces, laminate, and put in individual task card boxes. I will also be stashing this activity in my purse on Thanksgiving day to help keep my 2 year old busy while we are finishing cooking Thanksgiving dinner!
