Teaching phonics to a group of students who are all at different levels can be so tricky! Do you ever feel like you just don't have enough time in your day to find all the materials that you need to teach each and every student? I used to feel the exact same way until I started planning for my student groups through the use of assessment data. By giving a phonics assessment, you will be able to pinpoint the *exact* skills your students need to learn throughout the school year. You can [click here to grab my free phonics assessment.](https://theprimarybrain.com/small%20group%20reading/2023/08/22/Phonics-Skills-Assessment/)

Once you know the exact skills your students need to learn, it is time to form your phonics small groups. If you need help forming groups, read this post: [How To Use Data To Form Small Groups](https://theprimarybrain.com/small%20group%20reading/2023/08/25/How-To-Use-Data-To-Form-Small-Groups/)

Once you have your groups formed, it is time to find differentiated materials for all of your students! I created a set of phonics books you can use to address all skills that kindergarten and first grade students need to learn! I love finding ways to use the same style of resources for all of my students that each contain a different skill. This way, I can prep the same type of materials for each small group of students without spending hours finding materials and prepping different things.
