As we head into the back to school season, there is always so much to do! So, I teamed up with some teacher friends to help get you ready to start your year! I want to make your back to school planning as simple as possible, so I have put together some tips on how to prepare everything for teaching phonics in your small groups before the school year even starts! 

Teaching phonics to a group of students who are all at different levels can be so tricky! Do you ever feel like you just don't have enough time in your day to find all the materials that you need to teach each student? I used to feel the exact same way until I started planning for my student groups through the use of assessment data. 

By giving a phonics assessment, you will be able to pinpoint the *exact* skills your students need to learn throughout the school year. You can [click here to grab my free phonics assessment.](https://theprimarybrain.com/small%20group%20reading/2023/08/22/Phonics-Skills-Assessment/)

## Create Groups and Organize Materials
Once you know the exact skills your students need to learn, it is time to form your phonics small groups. If you need help forming groups, read this post: [How To Use Data To Form Small Groups](https://theprimarybrain.com/small%20group%20reading/2023/08/25/How-To-Use-Data-To-Form-Small-Groups/)

Once you have your groups formed, it is time to find differentiated materials for all of your students! To help you get started, I created a FREE set of phonics books you can use to address 3 skills that your students need to learn! I find it easiest to use the same style of resource with various skills for different levels. By using similiar resources, I find this saves me so much prep time during the school day.

To make planning easy for you this week, you can download 3 free books that work on cvc words, beginning blends, and magic e words. Just fill out this form:

<div id="fd-form-6696daed83b08a8b67b3d7b9"></div>
<script>
  window.fd('form', {
    formId: '6696daed83b08a8b67b3d7b9',
    containerEl: '#fd-form-6696daed83b08a8b67b3d7b9'
  });
</script>
