Are you looking for activities to do with your preschoolers this year? I know how challenging it can be to plan activities for preschoolers and I want to come alongside you to make this as easy as possible for you! I remember when I started planning preschool activities 7 years ago. I spent so many hours just pouring over resources to try to plan our preschool lessons, so I want to help you save time by sharing what we have sed in our home.

I want to take the guesswork out of creating preschool lesson plans so I put together our Preschool Curriculum Map to do just that! It maps out all 40 of our favorite preschool themes to use all year long. Just sign up here and I will email it right over to you:

<div id="fd-form-67f6c9bf1219852ff1fdceaf"></div>
<script>
  window.fd('form', {
    formId: '67f6c9bf1219852ff1fdceaf',
    containerEl: '#fd-form-67f6c9bf1219852ff1fdceaf'
  });
</script>

### What is a Curriculum Map?

This curriculum map is used to show an overview of the skills and topics taught in our curriculum. You know your child needs to learn a lot of new skills during their preschool years, but what are the skills and when should we teach them? My goal with this curriculum map is to help give you a roadmap of when to teach each skill to your preschooler over the course of the next year. 

### How to Use Your Preschool Curriculum Map

Now that you have your curriculum map, let's go over how you can use it! I created this curriculum map to give you the tools you need to teach your little ones! At the top of each page, you will see the following headers:
- Weekly Theme
- Literacy Skills
- Math Skills
- Fine Motor
- Sensory Play
- Arts and Crafts
- SEL/Science/Gross Motor

Under each header, you will see the skills we learn each week. It is so fun to watch our preschoolers learn new skills through play based activities. I hope you enjoy watching your littles learn new skills as they play!

## A Year of Preschool Weekly Learning Themes

![School Year Calendar for Toddlers]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/preschool-curriculum-map-school-year-calendar.jpg)

I have included our favorite 40 themes in the order I choose to teach them to my own children. There is no right or wrong order, but I hope this gives you a starting point. You can view the **school year calendar** in the download to see how each theme falls over the course of a school year. Some years there may be some adjusting needed depending on when holidays fall, but this will give you a great starting point!
