I love creating teaching resources that are based on themes that my students love. I like to spend the first couple weeks of school learning about what my students like to do, their favorite sports, colors, teams, pets, etc. I always see engagement increase during my lessons when I tie in student favorites. Here at home, I am doing the same thing for my own children. My son is just starting to add numbers and he wants to count anything and everything in sight. He is constantly asking me what one number plus another number equals. Since he is SUPER into all things construction, I created these quick and easy addition puzzles for him to work on.

Since this was Conner's first experience with addition facts, I started him out with doubles facts because these are easy to remember. He is able to count to 10, so I kept these addition facts within 10 to make sure he was successful. We are still working on doubles facts, but once he masters these, I will add in some additional facts.
