Are your children excited to catch that pesky leprechaun this year? Get ready to make memories with your little ones this St. Patrick's Day by planning a day filled with learning all centered around leprechauns, rainbows, pots of gold, and more!

## Build a Leprechaun Trap with Preschoolers

[![StPatricksUnit]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/st-patricks-day-sensory-bin.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/St-Patricks-Day-Preschool-Curriculum-Lesson-Plans-Toddler-PreK-Activities-13063202?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=St%20Patricks%20Preschool%20Post)

My favorite way to kick off St. Patrick's Day with preschoolers is through a hands-on sensory bin! Work on building a rainbow, a rainbow road, to a pot of gold, and throw in some pesky leprechauns and coins for extra fun! Your children can create imaginary play scenarios as they dig into this sensory bin! Here are a few materials you may want to use:

- pom pom balls
- beans
- gold coins
- magnets
- playdough
- leprechaun printables from [this unit](st-patricks-day-sensory-bin.jpg)
- the sky is the limit here!

## St. Patrick's Day Fine Motor Skills for Preschoolers

Fine motor skills are so important for our preschoolers, so don't let St. Patrick's Day go by without some hands-on fine motor practice!

### Lacing Cards

Lacing cards are a great tool for building hand control as children thread a lace through each hole of the card. To prepare these lacing cards, cut out each picture. Then, laminate and leave a small edge of lamination around each picture. Hole punch each dot and they will be ready for lots of hands to practice lacing! 

## Math Activities for Preschoolers

Our first math activity of the day is a color by shape page. You can use this activity to work on shapes, then watch as your littles find the shape on each page! 

Since our littles finish activities at different times, I love to use this math puzzle for fast finishers.

If you are completing these activities at home with your own children, then you can work through each activity at your child's pace. It's also fun to group up with a few other homeschool families for St. Patrick's day, too!

## St. Patrick's Day Craft for Preschoolers

I love incorporating crafts into all of our learning themes! To celebrate St. Patrick's Day, preschoolers will use a q-tip to dot each dot. 

[![StPatricksDayCraft]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/st-patricks-day-dot-painting.jpg)](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/St-Patricks-Day-Preschool-Curriculum-Lesson-Plans-Toddler-PreK-Activities-13063202?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=St%20Patricks%20Preschool%20Post)

To add an extra learning component, make sure to review color names as you pass out the materials. You can also have your littles work on creating patterns using the dots of paint.
