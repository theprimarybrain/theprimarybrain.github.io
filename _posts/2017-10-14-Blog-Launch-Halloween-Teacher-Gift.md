I am **SO EXCITED** to share my blog with you! My blog is truly a labor of love and I cannot believe it is finally done. To celebrate, I am giving you 7 days of free giveaways! Be sure to come back each day this week for some special goodies! 

Halloween is _just around the corner_ and if you are anything like me, then you are already planning fun activities for your students. This year, Halloween falls on a Tuesday and I will be celebrating the day with my students. Working on Halloween is **ROUGH** for teachers. I know from past experience that all the candy, costumes, and excitement will cause sheer exaustion by the time the day is done. 

This year I am making **spooky snacks** for my grade level team to offer a little pick me up. I am going to deliver these on October 30th as a reminder to my team that we are all in this together. Head on over to my TpT store to grab my [Treat Bag Tags Freebie](http://bit.ly/treattag). Thanks for stopping by my blog!
