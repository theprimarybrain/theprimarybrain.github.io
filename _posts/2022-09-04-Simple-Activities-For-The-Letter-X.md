When teaching and learning letters, there are many different ways to teach toddlers. But, with the letter X, it seems that the only two words ever used are xylophone and x-ray. So, how can you engage a learner with just two example words? Let’s leave the xylophone craft in the past and get our toddlers using their brains, fine and gross motor skills, and have fun while learning! There are tons of fun ways to use the word **x-ray** and teach your toddler all about the **letter X**. Here are just a few simple activities for the letter x.

Using white paint and black construction paper, your toddler, can create their x-ray image and easily use it to play doctor or practice writing the letter X around the image.

## Sensory Bins

Alphabet crafts and activities are _fantastic_, but toddlers love getting dirty. Creating a letter x skeleton sensory bin is a great way to let your child develop fine motor skills and create an “x-ray” of a skeleton out of popsicle sticks, playdoh, googly eyes, and more in the clear bin.
