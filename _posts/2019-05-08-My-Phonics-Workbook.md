Hello friends!! I have been secretly working on a special project over the past 6 months and I am so excited to share the news! After what feels like an eternity, I can FINALLY announce that I wrote a book! It is called [_My Phonics Workbook_](https://amzn.to/2DTwFlP) and it is now available for pre-order on Amazon! [_My Phonics Workbook_](https://amzn.to/2DTwFlP) includes the following elements:
* Letters A-Z - By beginning with letters, children learn the building blocks of individual consonant and vowel sounds.
* Sounds to Words - Cumulative lessons in this book allow new readers to progress from letter sounds to blends and digraphs.
* 101 awesome activities that include coloring, tracing, mazes, puzzles, word searches and more to keep kids motivated and excited to learn to read from the beginning to the end of the book.

Lots of exciting news will be coming over the next six weeks as we gear up for [_My Phonics Workbook_](https://amzn.to/2DTwFlP) to be released on June 18, 2019. I can't wait to share sneak peaks of my book, free resources to use with the book, and other fun details right here on my blog!
