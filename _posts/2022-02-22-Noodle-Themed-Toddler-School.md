Get ready for a fun week of noodle toddler activities! Noodles are always a hit with the little ones to eat and to learn with! I created this [Noodle Themed Toddler Unit](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Toddler-Activities-Lesson-Plans-Homeschool-Preschool-Curriculum-Letter-N-5010808?st=07e9e14865e03b51c0a88df1f34eb167&utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=Noodle%20Toddler%20School%20Unit) to bring a bit of noodle fun into your home. 

## Lesson Components 
This unit is made up of 5 lessons that will each work on the following activities:
- literacy/language 
- sensory bin 
- math and science activities
- fine motor activities
- gross motor activities 
- art activities

## Art Activities

My toddler was instantly intrigued when I told him we would be learning with noodles this week! We started off the unit by introducing the letter Nn. This Nn is for Noodle coloring page was the perfect way to explore the letter and sound, as well as work on fine motor coloring skills. We also enjoyed working on vocabulary and talking about all of the different types of noodles.

Have you ever experimented with painting using a variety of “paintbrushes”? Your little ones will love using cooked spaghetti dipped in paint.  If you’re using two different colors, the colors will overlap just by the nature of the project. This is a great opportunity to show your child what happens when colors mix and how primary colors mixed together can make new colors. Make sure you have lots of space and be prepared for messy hands and big smiles with this activity! 

## Fine Motor Activities

This fine motor activity uses plastic tweezers because they are a great tool to help build strong muscles in our little one’s hands. To begin, have your child use plastic tweezers to pick up different types of noodles and place them on the mat. This is also great hand-eye coordination practice. Your child can even place the noodles in different shapes or designs, like a flower, car, or train. 

## Sensory Bins

This sensory bin was a huge hit in our house! All you do is fill a bin with cooked spaghetti noodles and give your child some tongs, a fork, spoon, and a bowl. Then let your child scoop, squish, squeeze, and play with the spaghetti noodles. For extra fun, you can even color the noodles.

Dry noodles also make great filler for another noodle themed sensory bin! We love adding different cards to search for in the bin to add an academic component to the sensory bin experience. In this sensory bin activity, we used shape puzzles to find and match. This was also a great review of shapes and colors!

## Math Activity 

![NoodleToddler]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/Noodle-Toddler-Sorting-Colors.jpg)

Noodles are the perfect tool for little ones to count and sort. Just find at least five different types of noodles that your child can sort into bowls. Once your little one has sorted the noodles, have him or her count each type to see how many. This is great 1:1 correspondence practice and practice for counting in order.

Another great 1:1 correspondence activity is to use noodles to count and match numbers. It’s so important that our little ones get repeated practice with counting out a set of items. The noodles just add an extra layer of fun to the activity and are a great tactile experience to practice those counting skills.
