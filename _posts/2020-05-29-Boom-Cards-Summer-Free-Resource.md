Do you use Boom Cards™ with your students? They are one of my favorite tools for digital learning! I started creating them for my son at home and quickly saw all the ways that I can use Boom Cards with my first grade students! They are engaging, self-checking, paperless, and NO PREP! I love that I can assign differentiated decks of Boom Cards to my students that meet them exactly at their level. I really want you to fall in love with Boom like I have, so I put together a FREE CVC Word Boom Card set that you can try out today!

## Summer CVC Freebie
This Under the Sea Boom Card set is perfect for students who need a little extra practice with cvc words as they continue learning over the summer. Just fill out this form and I will send the Free Boom Cards right over to you! If you want extra cvc practice, you can also check out my [CVC Word Boom Card Bundle](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/CVC-Boom-Cards-Distance-Learning-BUNDLE-5489842?utm_source=PB%20Blog&utm_campaign=CVC%20Boom%20Cards%20Freebie%20Bundle%20Upsell).
